            <h3>Description for the Jury: Explain the Project in Full. [This is the description that should explain why the jury should give you the funds so try to answer any questions they might have. Please include some language on how the Flipizens will interact with the piece.]</h3>
<p>Two larger than life burner fabulous beings facing each other. 

Perhaps facing each other across cornfield row. 10 feet tall painted plywood cutouts. 2 sided with 2x4s sandwiched between and metal brackets for support. Stainless steel cable guy wires and deep auger anchors for stability. Landscape spotlights and LED strips for lighting. 

Perhaps a burner fabulous character in a cowboy hat facing off with a fabulous cow on hind legs trying to sneak into the burn. Or perhaps just two fabulous burners in cowboy hats, tutus, etc. Or perhaps two versions of one fabulous being looking at itself. Exact characters tbd, yet to be drawn.

Photos of the Vaughn, NM highway art included as part of the inspiration with a Texas burner flair.</p><h3>Application Art</h3>
<p><a href="./art/app-29-art-1.jpg" target="_blank" >app-29-art-1.jpg</a></p><p><a href="./art/app-29-art-2.jpg" target="_blank" >app-29-art-2.jpg</a></p><h3>Will it need power?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>If it will need power, what is your power plan?</h3>
<p>Extension cords to nearby generator. Possible theme camp placement nearby.</p><h3>Does the piece incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is it climbable?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>If it does incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is climbable what is your safety plan?  [Note: if flame effects are used, your project will be subject to inspection by the Burnable Art Lead, who has final say if your project will burn during the event.]</h3>
<p>** not provided **</p><h3>Does this piece already exist?</h3>
<p>Proposed Concept (Not Yet)</p><h3>What is your timeline detailing the planning, creation, installment, and leave no trace removal of your project?</h3>
<p>Final art and structural design to be completed by end of February. Creation to be completed by end of March. Transportation and installation to be discussed and determined concurrently by end of March. 

Possible coordination of use of loading trucks to transport to land. I will be volunteering for loadout either way.

I will make plans for assistance, and use of equipment like ladders for on site installation. I intend to volunteer in other departments to fall early entry, and hope to set it up early. 

I will make plans to either remove it timely during Monday exodus, or coordinate having it loaded out to the warehouse. In which case I would volunteer for loading once again, and would organize others to volunteer as well.</p><h3>Have you completed any other large scale art projects? Tell us about it/them: (In this media? Where and when? How did the project go? Did you learn any lessons from those projects we should know?)</h3>
<p>I've done several involved art projects that required dozens of hours, needed to be broken into phases and have gotten quite good at monitoring time management (I do far less last minute work than earlier projects). 

This is my first project of this size in wood but I do have experience in wood, both firsthand and working on larger projects with others. I have a decent understanding of the structural engineering challenges I will face and plan to lean on the advice of experts I know.</p><h3>Past Projects Art</h3>
<p>** not provided **</p><h3>What is the amount you would like to receive? Please enter a dollar amount in this field.</h3>
<p>$575.00</p><h3>Budget Spreadsheet</h3>
<p><a href="./budget/app-29-budget.pdf" target="_blank" >app-29-budget.pdf</a></p><h3>Alternative Budget-What is the minimum amount that you would need to bring a version of your project? Please provide an alternate dollar amount that will allow the expression of your vision and concept at a reduced scale. The Art Grant budget is limited and this will allow the jury an opportunity to consider funding a lower cost piece instead of passing on it altogether.</h3>
<p>300</p><h3>Alternative Budget Description (if you would change the piece to match the new budget, please tell us how):</h3>
<p>I could scale it down. Smaller, less Heightened Forms. The girls could also be one sides rather than 2 sides which would half the amount of plywood.</p><h3>Have you ever received an art grant in the past?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>Have you received funding from any other entity or regional for this piece previously? If so, who and how much and what are you changing? (Having received past funding will not disqualify you if you are using the funds to add to the piece.)</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>We may be having the next Ignition Philter fundraiser in Austin in fall of 2025 or spring of 2026. If the piece is still intact, would you be willing/ able to bring the piece to that event? [Or do you have another piece you would like to bring instead?]</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>In 2025-2026 We are hoping the some of the artists can give community workshops outside of Flipside at Lloyd, our Austin workshop. Do you think you have a workshop idea that could be provided to the community? If so, please tell us what it is</h3>
<p>Perhaps an art class where I bring supplies for repurposed trash art. Trash to Tableau. Painting with Plastic. </p>
