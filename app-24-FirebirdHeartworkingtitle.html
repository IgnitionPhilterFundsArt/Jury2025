        <h1>24 - Firebird Heart (working title)</h1>
        <hr/>
        <h3>Description for the Jury: Explain the Project in Full. [This is the description that should explain why the jury should give you the funds so try to answer any questions they might have. Please include some language on how the Flipizens will interact with the piece.]</h3>
<p>The birth of the heart occurs soon after conception. In November 2024, from a single abstract idea sketch that came from a moment of connection with creative spirit, we iterated a tangible vision and submitted our 2025 Honoraria Letter of Intent to BRC for Firebird (working title). What we are asking for in this Flipside grant proposal is to birth the heart of Firebird and let Flipizens be the nascent beings that not merely witness but also participate in the creation of the spirit of the heart of the larger installation – the pulsing heart of Firebird itself. Different than the Phoenix, this large-scale art installation is our conceptualized version of engaging with the folklore of the Firebird: a legendary bird made of flames that not only symbolizes the transformative experience of voluntary destruction and wisdom rebirth, but also an introspective journey into the generous heart. In Firebird folklore, you and your tribe – your camp – were only given the gift of fire if Firebird determined your heart was sincerely kind. As we build Firebird in DFW for playa placement, we are reaching out to all of our community – not just burners, but friends, collaborators, artists, engineers – anyone with a passion for and dedication to creating meaningful art – to create Firebird. Energy that creates life can be found in a village working together to make beautiful things. Firebird overall will be created using metal, wood, textile, and light, and is estimated in a 25’x25’ space with the bird and wings being approximately 15’ in height. This full installation will be what is placed on playa. However, we are building the nest, bird body, head, articulating wings, tail, and heart separately to then be assembled on playa. The heart will be the nucleus of the installation measuring approximately 2’x2’x3’. The heart will be made from recycled and reused metal and mirror materials. We are aiming for 50% or more prefabricated materials to make it as much of a creative reuse artwork as possible to lessen the impact to the environment and make a statement about how we view consumerism and our waste. The mirror material will reflect whatever it is that Flipizens see within themselves. It will stand on a metal frame supported from underneath. At the center of the heart will be a light source that will be powered by 1-4 hand crank pulley systems that work as a generator to illuminate the heart by the effort of all the Flipizens that choose to try to crank it as bright as it can go. Basically, a Flipizen can intentionally interact with the piece by choosing to crank the generator, thus transforming physical effort into heart light. There are more than one so that Flipizens can crank together, creating light together, if they wish. These cranks will be on stationary pillars placed in an arc approximately 3-5’ around the heart. At least one hand crank will be lower to the ground to allow for those with accessibility considerations and/or children/youth to also interact with the art. A rotary counter will be attached to each hand crank that allows for allocating how many rotations of effort Flipizens have invested to power the heart’s light. This will be creatively integrated into the overall Firebird piece on playa as a recognition of the gift of Flipizens to BRC citizens. When not being cranked and/or at night, a small solar kit will be utilized to keep the heart internally bright. At the end of Flipside, the heart will be removed in its entirety (no burn), the hand cranks will be removed (materials will be reused and the power for the heart will be provided by the large scale installation power supply), the counters tallied, and it will be integrated into the larger Firebird piece as the build completes for on playa assembly. Flipizens would be the only village to have “charged” the heart with powerful fire light. Interacting with the hand cranks to create heart light gives rise to all Flipizens becoming a collaborating artist on the artwork and hopefully creates good vibes that will continue on to playa for BRC participants to experience at Burning Man 2025, giving Firebird a heart birth that was solely created Deep in the Art of Texas.</p><h3>Application Art</h3>
<p><a href="./art/app-24-art-1.png" target="_blank" >app-24-art-1.png</a></p><p><a href="./art/app-24-art-2.png" target="_blank" >app-24-art-2.png</a></p><p><a href="./art/app-24-art-3.png" target="_blank" >app-24-art-3.png</a></p><h3>Will it need power?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>If it will need power, what is your power plan?</h3>
<p>Power plan is fully utilizing the 1-4 hand crank generator systems (low- to no-noise). A solar panel kit element (with back up battery) would potentially be attached for ongoing light during night viewing. We will have a small generator on hand during the event as a contingency. </p><h3>Does the piece incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is it climbable?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>If it does incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is climbable what is your safety plan?  [Note: if flame effects are used, your project will be subject to inspection by the Burnable Art Lead, who has final say if your project will burn during the event.]</h3>
<p>Technically the art itself is not moveable. Only the hand crank systems, which will be placed adjacent to the heart in aesthetically pleasing and accessible locations, would be rotatable, but no part of the installation would have moveable pieces nor is it climbable. We would post a “no climb” sign(s) if needed. </p><h3>Does this piece already exist?</h3>
<p>Proposed Concept (Not Yet)</p><h3>What is your timeline detailing the planning, creation, installment, and leave no trace removal of your project?</h3>
<p>We are currently in pre-production planning for the overall Firebird project and plan on beginning its build as soon as mid-March. Firebird Heart has been conceptualized and is on an accelerated timeline mostly due to the opportunity for this grant funding. It is our plan to source prefabricated materials and complete the final design concept in mid-February 2025. Once we know if our grant proposal was accepted and assuming funding will be provided, we will begin executing our build for Firebird Heart mid-February, which will go through mid-April 2025. We will execute all testing of the power and light interactivity during build prior to mid-April 2025. Installment of the artwork will be based on Flipside recommendations so that it is fully installed, tested, and ready to go prior to the opening day of the event. After the event, the entire artwork will be fully removed from Flipside and proper LNT practices will be executed upon to ensure that the land and environment is returned to the state it was prior to the event. We are dedicated not only to eco-conscious practices throughout build and install, but all activities of the LNT principle to respect the environment and atmosphere of the event overall. </p><h3>Have you completed any other large scale art projects? Tell us about it/them: (In this media? Where and when? How did the project go? Did you learn any lessons from those projects we should know?)</h3>
<p>I have done decor for the [*****] tent for the past few years, and have done an art project of artifying old stuffed animals and adopting them out. From the projects I have done, I have learned to enlist others that want to help and always give yourself lots of time to create.</p><h3>Past Projects Art</h3>

<p><a href="./budget/app-24-budget.pdf" target="_blank" >app-24-budget.pdf</a></p><h3>Alternative Budget-What is the minimum amount that you would need to bring a version of your project? Please provide an alternate dollar amount that will allow the expression of your vision and concept at a reduced scale. The Art Grant budget is limited and this will allow the jury an opportunity to consider funding a lower cost piece instead of passing on it altogether.</h3>
<p>0</p><h3>Alternative Budget Description (if you would change the piece to match the new budget, please tell us how):</h3>
<p>We would potentially lessen the amount of hand cranks, change the lighting to a cheaper alternative, most likely just use a battery pack for the light, and source 100% of the materials to construct the heart from foraging, dumpster diving, and other non-monetary exchanged means, aka creative reuse. We will honestly take whatever is offered. My crew and I are dedicated to this project. We will fundraise the remaining funds to the best of our ability and adapt the project to make it a reality. </p><h3>Have you ever received an art grant in the past?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>Have you received funding from any other entity or regional for this piece previously? If so, who and how much and what are you changing? (Having received past funding will not disqualify you if you are using the funds to add to the piece.)</h3>
<p>No, however, we submitted our first grant proposal request and are currently awaiting the results of the 2025 Honoraria Grant Program funding for the full Firebird art installation from the BRC Grant Committee. We are attempting to unify our funding needs with both the BRC grant program and the Flipside grant program to bridge together support from the burner community to one overall art installation by funding the parts and the overall project.</p><h3>We may be having the next Ignition Philter fundraiser in Austin in fall of 2025 or spring of 2026. If the piece is still intact, would you be willing/ able to bring the piece to that event? [Or do you have another piece you would like to bring instead?]</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>In 2025-2026 We are hoping the some of the artists can give community workshops outside of Flipside at Lloyd, our Austin workshop. Do you think you have a workshop idea that could be provided to the community? If so, please tell us what it is</h3>
<p>Most definitely! As a creative reuse and visionary artist, it is my joy and mission to teach others about how we can lessen our impact on the environment by reusing materials for everyday use – especially in our art! I would be happy to provide a workshop on creative reuse techniques for both small- and large-scale art, or anything else that is desired or needed in that space! I can also do a workshop on creative reuse for functional items, not just for artistic value.</p>
