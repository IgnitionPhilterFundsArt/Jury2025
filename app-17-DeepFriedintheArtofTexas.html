        <h3>Description for the Jury: Explain the Project in Full. [This is the description that should explain why the jury should give you the funds so try to answer any questions they might have. Please include some language on how the Flipizens will interact with the piece.]</h3>
<p>[we] just did Friday FryDay -  fried fair food for the OtherWorld’s Fair for FreezerBurn 2025. The [*****] fried up Jalopeno popper egg rolls, funnel cakes Oreos, corn dogs, and more! During this event we also “Poor Dashed” the fried food across the playa to volunteers and anyone needing food brought to them. 

Food is an art form and what better way to display that art than deep frying it in oil! 

We expanded the trailer park with our Flamper experiment at FZB2025. The Flamper was the backdrop for our frying event and also hosted entertaining and unique art. It was a very popular event/art installment that we would like to continue offering at Flipside, but would need extra help with costs. Deep Fried in the Art of Texas *clap*clap*clap* - will have  unique offerings of fried food on FryDay (7-9pm), we will also have multiple art pieces that will be incorporated into the theme and event. </p><h3>Application Art</h3>

<p>Yes</p><h3>If it will need power, what is your power plan?</h3>
<p>Generator </p><h3>Does the piece incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is it climbable?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>If it does incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is climbable what is your safety plan?  [Note: if flame effects are used, your project will be subject to inspection by the Burnable Art Lead, who has final say if your project will burn during the event.]</h3>
<p>** not provided **</p><h3>Does this piece already exist?</h3>
<p>Existing Artwork (it's done, just need help bringing it to Flipside)</p><h3>What is your timeline detailing the planning, creation, installment, and leave no trace removal of your project?</h3>
<p>We will be on the land and have our trailer park set up Thursday. We will host the event in the [camp] on Friday. We did a trial run at Freezerburn and was able to dispose of used oil by funneling into used jugs and followed all LNT guidelines. </p><h3>Have you completed any other large scale art projects? Tell us about it/them: (In this media? Where and when? How did the project go? Did you learn any lessons from those projects we should know?)</h3>
<p>Flipside 2025 will be our 11th burn and we always bring fun art to each one. We’ve had one art grant project for FZB2024 for a “Burnt Freezer.” (Pictured) We also have been given an art grant for a mirage fan for Myschievia 2024. Both were  made and loved by many at each burn. 

Other projects like missed calls, that 70s lamp, and OtherWorlds Portal have been self funded. This particular asking for an art grant for food, we have never done. But we did a similar event that was self funded for freezerburn and it was a big hit. </p><h3>Past Projects Art</h3>
<p><a href="./past/app-17-past-1.jpeg" target="_blank" >app-17-past-1.jpeg</a></p><h3>What is the amount you would like to receive? Please enter a dollar amount in this field.</h3>
<p>$300.00</p><h3>Budget Spreadsheet</h3>
<p><a href="./budget/app-17-budget.pdf" target="_blank" >app-17-budget.pdf</a></p><h3>Alternative Budget-What is the minimum amount that you would need to bring a version of your project? Please provide an alternate dollar amount that will allow the expression of your vision and concept at a reduced scale. The Art Grant budget is limited and this will allow the jury an opportunity to consider funding a lower cost piece instead of passing on it altogether.</h3>
<p>$200</p><h3>Alternative Budget Description (if you would change the piece to match the new budget, please tell us how):</h3>
<p>I would still do the same offering, just on a smaller scale. Less food. Less options. </p><h3>Have you ever received an art grant in the past?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>Have you received funding from any other entity or regional for this piece previously? If so, who and how much and what are you changing? (Having received past funding will not disqualify you if you are using the funds to add to the piece.)</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>We may be having the next Ignition Philter fundraiser in Austin in fall of 2025 or spring of 2026. If the piece is still intact, would you be willing/ able to bring the piece to that event? [Or do you have another piece you would like to bring instead?]</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>In 2025-2026 We are hoping the some of the artists can give community workshops outside of Flipside at Lloyd, our Austin workshop. Do you think you have a workshop idea that could be provided to the community? If so, please tell us what it is</h3>
<p>If food has never been given an art grant before and I am the first. I would be open to talking about food as an art form and offering to the community. </p>
