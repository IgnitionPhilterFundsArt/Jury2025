        <h3>Description for the Jury: Explain the Project in Full. [This is the description that should explain why the jury should give you the funds so try to answer any questions they might have. Please include some language on how the Flipizens will interact with the piece.]</h3>
<p>Flux Fabric is an updated technology to our Taco Space stations geodesic dome, it will allow us to bend the space-time continuum </p><h3>Application Art</h3>
<p><a href="./art/app-10-art-1.jpg" target="_blank" >app-10-art-1.jpg</a></p><h3>Will it need power?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>If it will need power, what is your power plan?</h3>
<p>** not provided **</p><h3>Does the piece incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is it climbable?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>If it does incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is climbable what is your safety plan?  [Note: if flame effects are used, your project will be subject to inspection by the Burnable Art Lead, who has final say if your project will burn during the event.]</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>Does this piece already exist?</h3>
<p>Proposed Concept (Not Yet)</p><h3>What is your timeline detailing the planning, creation, installment, and leave no trace removal of your project?</h3>
<p>Week 1: We will be using a laser cutter to cut the pieces of lycra stretch fabric
Week 2:  Sewing the edges of the different triangles so that the fabric pieces will not stretch as much and last longer. 

On site building: 
Set Geodesic dome up 1/3 of way- Tie on Lycra fabric that goes on top 
Set up Geodesic dome 2/3 of way- Hang the lycra that goes in the middle of the walls 
Set up Geodome fully- Tie on rest of lycra that goes onto the side walls that we havent yet. 
</p><h3>Have you completed any other large scale art projects? Tell us about it/them: (In this media? Where and when? How did the project go? Did you learn any lessons from those projects we should know?)</h3>
<p>I have been a sound camp lead for Freezerburn Texas since 2014, in 2023 I received a grant for an augmented reality project that projected augmented reality of those in front of it allowing people to see  an alternative version of what we currently see. I'm a digital artist for the metaverse (VR environment developer), and also a VJ who does everything from pre rendered clips, to real time visuals, also video mashing with random clips I get from TV/movies/nature documentaries. </p><h3>Past Projects Art</h3>
<p><a href="./past/app-10-past-1.jpg" target="_blank" >app-10-past-1.jpg</a></p><p><a href="./past/app-10-past-2.jpg" target="_blank" >app-10-past-2.jpg</a></p><h3>What is the amount you would like to receive? Please enter a dollar amount in this field.</h3>
<p>$500.00</p><h3>Budget Spreadsheet</h3>
<p><a href="./budget/app-10-budget.png" target="_blank" >app-10-budget.png</a></p><h3>Alternative Budget-What is the minimum amount that you would need to bring a version of your project? Please provide an alternate dollar amount that will allow the expression of your vision and concept at a reduced scale. The Art Grant budget is limited and this will allow the jury an opportunity to consider funding a lower cost piece instead of passing on it altogether.</h3>
<p>$350</p><h3>Alternative Budget Description (if you would change the piece to match the new budget, please tell us how):</h3>
<p>(numbers shown in screenshot of spreadsheet) We would simple order less lycra, the building process would be the same. </p><h3>Have you ever received an art grant in the past?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>Have you received funding from any other entity or regional for this piece previously? If so, who and how much and what are you changing? (Having received past funding will not disqualify you if you are using the funds to add to the piece.)</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>We may be having the next Ignition Philter fundraiser in Austin in fall of 2025 or spring of 2026. If the piece is still intact, would you be willing/ able to bring the piece to that event? [Or do you have another piece you would like to bring instead?]</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>In 2025-2026 We are hoping the some of the artists can give community workshops outside of Flipside at Lloyd, our Austin workshop. Do you think you have a workshop idea that could be provided to the community? If so, please tell us what it is</h3>
<p>I could do a workshop on VJing, (mixing concert visuals/visual story telling)  or the process in which we built this project. </p>
