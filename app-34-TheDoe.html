        <h3>Application Number</h3>
<p></p><h3>Description for the Jury: Explain the Project in Full. [This is the description that should explain why the jury should give you the funds so try to answer any questions they might have. Please include some language on how the Flipizens will interact with the piece.]</h3>
<p>For this piece I drew inspiration from childhood memories of crafting paper dolls, my love for nature and forest. I designed a whimsical, large-scale jointed puppet(10-12ft) made from painted plywood. Equipped with wooden poles on the hands and feet, for interactive movement, the puppet invites viewers to interact and play. This puppet has a lot of nostalgia for me, creating dolls and characters as a child and escaping into my daydreams. The hope is that it invokes this same nostalgia into the viewer.</p><h3>Will it need power?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>If it will need power, what is your power plan?</h3>
<p>** not provided **</p><h3>Does the piece incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is it climbable?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>If it does incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is climbable what is your safety plan?  [Note: if flame effects are used, your project will be subject to inspection by the Burnable Art Lead, who has final say if your project will burn during the event.]</h3>
<p>** not provided **</p><h3>Does this piece already exist?</h3>
<p>Proposed Concept (Not Yet)</p><h3>What is your timeline detailing the planning, creation, installment, and leave no trace removal of your project?</h3>
<p>I think this project will take me about two weeks. The longest steps would be cutting the wood and sanding. I think that would take about three days, painting probably 4-5 days. For the accessories details and assembly and  I think it will take about a day or two. </p><h3>Have you completed any other large scale art projects? Tell us about it/them: (In this media? Where and when? How did the project go? Did you learn any lessons from those projects we should know?)</h3>
<p>Yes, I have made many large scale mixed media projects. In the past I’ve  made projects out of metal and wood. In the most recent years, I’ve been experimenting with costumes, Mostly making costumes out of fabric and found plastic. I think the thing that I’ve learned the most from all of my projects is that you have to be innovative when things don’t go as planned. I think this is one of my strongest skill set’s is being able to adapt projects and use what I have.</p><h3>What is the amount you would like to receive? Please enter a dollar amount in this field.</h3>
<p>$360.00</p><h3>Budget</h3>
<p>app 34-budget.xlsx</p><h3>Alternative Budget-What is the minimum amount that you would need to bring a version of your project? Please provide an alternate dollar amount that will allow the expression of your vision and concept at a reduced scale. The Art Grant budget is limited and this will allow the jury an opportunity to consider funding a lower cost piece instead of passing on it altogether.</h3>
<p>275</p><h3>Alternative Budget Description (if you would change the piece to match the new budget, please tell us how):</h3>
<p>My most expensive expense for this project would be purchasing a circular saw, to make the project more affordable I could rent a circular saw or borrow someone’s. I could also use cheaper plywood.</p><h3>Have you ever received an art grant in the past?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>Have you received funding from any other entity or regional for this piece previously? If so, who and how much and what are you changing? (Having received past funding will not disqualify you if you are using the funds to add to the piece.)</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>We may be having the next Ignition Philter fundraiser in Austin in fall of 2025 or spring of 2026. If the piece is still intact, would you be willing/ able to bring the piece to that event? [Or do you have another piece you would like to bring instead?]</h3>
<p>Maybe</p><h3>In 2025-2026 We are hoping the some of the artists can give community workshops outside of Flipside at Lloyd, our Austin workshop. Do you think you have a workshop idea that could be provided to the community? If so, please tell us what it is</h3>
<p>Zine workshop, sewing workshop, college workshop. </p><h3>Application Art</h3>
