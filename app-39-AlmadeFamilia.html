        <h3>Application Number</h3>
<p></p><h3>Description for the Jury: Explain the Project in Full. [This is the description that should explain why the jury should give you the funds so try to answer any questions they might have. Please include some language on how the Flipizens will interact with the piece.]</h3>
<p>"Alma de Familia" was conceived by visionary artists associated with the regional burner community of San Antonio, TX. The name "Alma," translating to "soul" in Spanish, is apt for this art piece as it mirrors the very essence of cultural and artistic contributions made by the creators.
The installation revolves around a representation of Spanish colonial missions that transformed the region in the 1700s. These missions mark the beginning of the melding of cultures that is still a defining characteristic of  modern San Antonio. The theme of this art piece visually represents San Antonio's rich history, renowned for housing the oldest buildings in Texas.
Some of the most important and prominently featured elements of the piece are sculptures designed and created by local artists representing their own respective cultures. Pre-colonial Mexican culture is still proudly celebrated throughout the city and will be represented by an amalgamation of images from traditional holidays.
When the nearby merry-go-round spins, the 3 large mission bells ring, sending their message across the playa. At night, spotlights projected inside the mission make it appear to glow from within, casting a mesmerizing blend of shadows and lights onto the moving bells. This interactive feature invites viewers to engage with the artwork, providing an opportunity to experience the vitality of the city's history, deeply intertwined with the soul of San Antonio.
The mission is positioned atop a box adorned with carved-out and painted imagery on all sides, symbolizing the multicultural and accepting nature of the city's people, its history, and its present. Torches illuminate the surroundings at night, guiding the way to the entrances. Inside, a blend of modern visionary art and paintings in the traditional style encapsulates the duality within the city's artist community, renowned for its prolific street art and appreciation for old methods. One of the walls is dedicated to an Ofrenda, a family altar, symbolizing family as the cornerstone of San Antonio's existence throughout its history and cultural blend. Two of the walls have windows representing different aspects of the city’s identity, from the famous Rose Window of Mission San Jose to the jail window to the one that looks into the nature of the region.
"Alma de Familia" is not merely an art installation; it is a thoughtful reflection of San Antonio's unique multicultural identity, a testament to the city's old spirit, and a heartfelt homage to its roots.
</p><h3>Will it need power?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>If it will need power, what is your power plan?</h3>
<p>All lights used for this installation are solar or battery powered, eliminating the need for a generator. </p><h3>Does the piece incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is it climbable?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>If it does incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is climbable what is your safety plan?  [Note: if flame effects are used, your project will be subject to inspection by the Burnable Art Lead, who has final say if your project will burn during the event.]</h3>
<p>This installation does not incorporate flame effects and is not climbable, however it contains moving pieces activated by the nearby merry-go-round. All moving parts are at least 9’ off the ground and outside people’s reach.
</p><h3>Does this piece already exist?</h3>
<p>In Progress (Making Changes)</p><h3>What is your timeline detailing the planning, creation, installment, and leave no trace removal of your project?</h3>
<p>The tower is partially built, art pieces are being currently worked on. We plan to install all towers the weekend before the event and teardown after. All components will be removed and area swept for MOOP.
</p><h3>Have you completed any other large scale art projects? Tell us about it/them: (In this media? Where and when? How did the project go? Did you learn any lessons from those projects we should know?)</h3>
<p>This is the first art project of this size that I worked on. Our team have successfully brought large components of Alma de Familia to FreezerBurn 2025.</p><h3>What is the amount you would like to receive? Please enter a dollar amount in this field.</h3>
<p>$1,000.00</p><h3>Budget</h3>
<p>app 39 budget.xlsx</p><h3>Alternative Budget-What is the minimum amount that you would need to bring a version of your project? Please provide an alternate dollar amount that will allow the expression of your vision and concept at a reduced scale. The Art Grant budget is limited and this will allow the jury an opportunity to consider funding a lower cost piece instead of passing on it altogether.</h3>
<p>575</p><h3>Alternative Budget Description (if you would change the piece to match the new budget, please tell us how):</h3>
<p>Overall budget for this project is way more than $1000 and we are attempting to raise these funds privately. It has been a big undertaking and every dollar helps</p><h3>Have you ever received an art grant in the past?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>Have you received funding from any other entity or regional for this piece previously? If so, who and how much and what are you changing? (Having received past funding will not disqualify you if you are using the funds to add to the piece.)</h3>
<p>We received funding from FreezerBurn, but it covered only a small portion of the actual costs. Please see the spreadsheet for cost breakdown.</p><h3>We may be having the next Ignition Philter fundraiser in Austin in fall of 2025 or spring of 2026. If the piece is still intact, would you be willing/ able to bring the piece to that event? [Or do you have another piece you would like to bring instead?]</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>In 2025-2026 We are hoping the some of the artists can give community workshops outside of Flipside at Lloyd, our Austin workshop. Do you think you have a workshop idea that could be provided to the community? If so, please tell us what it is</h3>
<p>We intend to keep outer walls of the pedestal and combine them with walls from other components to make another art piece that can be displayed at Ignition Philter fundraiser in the spring of 2026

Post event this art piece is heading for Burning Man 2025 as a part of Whirl of Art  project and will be burned there. Our team can organize a workshop in 2025 with a panel of artists who have successfully taken projects to Burning Man in the past talking about the process, funding, project management, successes and pitfalls.</p><h3>Application Art</h3>
