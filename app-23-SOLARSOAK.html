        <h3>Description for the Jury: Explain the Project in Full. [This is the description that should explain why the jury should give you the funds so try to answer any questions they might have. Please include some language on how the Flipizens will interact with the piece.]</h3>
<p>For the third consecutive year, we are excited to bring the Solar Soak to the eventâ€”a relaxing and communal experience featuring two naturally heated swimming pools for Flipizens to soak in and a third pool dedicated to cleaning and purifying the water. The pools will be primarily heated by the sun, making them both eco-friendly and enjoyable.

We have most of the infrastructure in place but are seeking funds to support the transportation of water from the local city hall, trailer rental, pool chemicals, and a dedicated pump. 

Flipizens will not only enjoy soaking in the pools but also witnessing the art of pool maintenance performed by our dedicated pool custodian. The pools will be cleaned at least twice daily or every three hours as needed, ensuring a safe and enjoyable experience for everyone.

Flipizens will be required to wash their feet and agree to the pool rules prior to entry. Our team of custodians will be on hand to ensure adherence to these rules and maintain the safety and hygiene of the pools.

This project has been a well-received service to the community in the past, and we look forward to continuing this tradition at Flipside 2025.</p><h3>Application Art</h3>
<p><a href="./art/app-23-art-1.jpg" target="_blank" >app-23-art-1.jpg</a></p><h3>Will it need power?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>If it will need power, what is your power plan?</h3>
<p>Power will be provided by our generator.</p><h3>Does the piece incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is it climbable?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>If it does incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is climbable what is your safety plan?  [Note: if flame effects are used, your project will be subject to inspection by the Burnable Art Lead, who has final say if your project will burn during the event.]</h3>
<p>The pools will be monitored continuously by a pool custodian during open hours. A maximum of 12 people will be allowed in each pool at a time. Pools are 18 inches deep, with a rotating shift system to manage long lines. Pools will be closed at night for maintenance. Rules include no sexual conduct, clothing optional, and no horseplay.</p><h3>Does this piece already exist?</h3>
<p>Existing Artwork (it's done, just need help bringing it to Flipside)</p><h3>What is your timeline detailing the planning, creation, installment, and leave no trace removal of your project?</h3>
<p>Setup and Construction:
Request early entry to the event site. Construct the pools onsite, including assembling the pool structures and setting up the filtration system. This process will take approximately 2 hours. Transport water to the event site using water cubes. It will take approximately 2 trips (2 hours per trip) to fill the pools.
Leave No Trace Removal:
Chlorine will be neutralized by peroxide and pH balanced prior to disposal.
Deconstruct pools and pack up all equipment and materials. Ensure the area is left in its original condition.</p><h3>Have you completed any other large scale art projects? Tell us about it/them: (In this media? Where and when? How did the project go? Did you learn any lessons from those projects we should know?)</h3>
<p>We have successfully installed The Solar Soak at Flipside for the past two years, providing a beautiful and refreshing experience for the Flipizens. Our team is confident in our ability to deliver a high-quality and well-maintained art installation.

In addition to The Solar Soak, we have also built and brought a homemade hot tub to a previous burn event. This project was a great success, offering a unique and enjoyable experience for participants. We learned valuable lessons about the importance of robust construction, efficient water heating, and ongoing maintenance to ensure a safe and pleasant experience for everyone.

Furthermore, we played a key role in the construction of the Cosmic Creatures Zome project, a collaborative art installation that involved intricate design and assembly. This experience taught us the significance of teamwork, precise planning, and attention to detail in executing large-scale projects.

Our past experiences have equipped us with the skills and knowledge needed to create and manage art installations that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing. We are excited to bring The Solar Soak back for another year and continue to enhance the experience for all attendees.</p><h3>Past Projects Art</h3>

Please enter a dollar amount in this field.</h3>
<p>$364.00</p><h3>Budget Spreadsheet</h3>
<p><a href="./budget/app-23-budget.png" target="_blank" >app-23-budget.png</a></p><h3>Alternative Budget-What is the minimum amount that you would need to bring a version of your project? Please provide an alternate dollar amount that will allow the expression of your vision and concept at a reduced scale. The Art Grant budget is limited and this will allow the jury an opportunity to consider funding a lower cost piece instead of passing on it altogether.</h3>
<p>$252.00</p><h3>Alternative Budget Description (if you would change the piece to match the new budget, please tell us how):</h3>
<p>We would reduce the budget by forgoing the pump. While this would slow down the filtration process, however it would still meet the minimum requirements for maintaining the pools.</p><h3>Have you ever received an art grant in the past?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>Have you received funding from any other entity or regional for this piece previously? If so, who and how much and what are you changing? (Having received past funding will not disqualify you if you are using the funds to add to the piece.)</h3>
<p>Yes, Cosmic Creatures purchased the pools, chemicals, test strips, and the trailer during last year's event. The cost was about the same as the current budget, with an additional expense for the pools, which cost $336.57. This year, we are seeking funding for transportation, pool supplies, water, and an enhanced pump to improve the overall experience.</p><h3>We may be having the next Ignition Philter fundraiser in Austin in fall of 2025 or spring of 2026. If the piece is still intact, would you be willing/ able to bring the piece to that event? [Or do you have another piece you would like to bring instead?]</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>In 2025-2026 We are hoping the some of the artists can give community workshops outside of Flipside at Lloyd, our Austin workshop. Do you think you have a workshop idea that could be provided to the community? If so, please tell us what it is</h3>
<p>I do not.</p>
