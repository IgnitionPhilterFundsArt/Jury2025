            <h3>Description for the Jury: Explain the Project in Full. [This is the description that should explain why the jury should give you the funds so try to answer any questions they might have. Please include some language on how the Flipizens will interact with the piece.]</h3>
<p>I want to bring my race track mixed reality game to Flipside. I have set up a couple RC cars with steering wheels and pedals that have a live view projected onto a screen. I plan to have it working with 2 players simultaneously, and have prizes for fastest lap times as well as some other more fun prizes. The track will be lined with LEDs that are synced to the lap timing system. I will have a leaderboard on display whenever possible. The event is all contained and run inside a walled 10X10 EZ-up, with the projection going onto a white wall so people outside can watch while others race. The event will only be run when it is dark, because the projections do not show up very well in the day.</p><h3>Application Art</h3>
<p><a href="./art/app-8-art-1.png" target="_blank" >app-8-art-1.png</a></p><p><a href="./art/app-8-art-2.png" target="_blank" >app-8-art-2.png</a></p><h3>Will it need power?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>If it will need power, what is your power plan?</h3>
<p>I plan on camping with either of two camps, both of which will have generators that I can use.</p><h3>Does the piece incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is it climbable?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>If it does incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is climbable what is your safety plan?  [Note: if flame effects are used, your project will be subject to inspection by the Burnable Art Lead, who has final say if your project will burn during the event.]</h3>
<p>The moveable pieces (steering wheels) are attached to a table, and the pedals are simply placed on the ground.</p><h3>Does this piece already exist?</h3>
<p>In Progress (Making Changes)</p><h3>What is your timeline detailing the planning, creation, installment, and leave no trace removal of your project?</h3>
<p>I had taken it to Freezerburn, but it got damaged in the high winds, so I need to repair it. I have the parts on the way to redo the lights on it, and will continue decorating it until mid March. I also have to adjust some of the technical junk to get two -player working. </p><h3>Have you completed any other large scale art projects? Tell us about it/them: (In this media? Where and when? How did the project go? Did you learn any lessons from those projects we should know?)</h3>
<p>I have done this event two times in the past, once with an RC controller, once with wheel and pedals. New tracks each time with an RFID timing system. I have worked out many of the technical issues, and continue to remove any from the project when possible.</p><h3>Past Projects Art</h3>
<p>** not provided **</p><h3>What is the amount you would like to receive? Please enter a dollar amount in this field.</h3>
<p>$288.46</p><h3>Budget Spreadsheet</h3>
<p><a href="./budget/app-8-budget.pdf" target="_blank" >app-8-budget.pdf</a></p><h3>Alternative Budget-What is the minimum amount that you would need to bring a version of your project? Please provide an alternate dollar amount that will allow the expression of your vision and concept at a reduced scale. The Art Grant budget is limited and this will allow the jury an opportunity to consider funding a lower cost piece instead of passing on it altogether.</h3>
<p>123.26</p><h3>Alternative Budget Description (if you would change the piece to match the new budget, please tell us how):</h3>
<p>I would only purchase LEDs and the parts to fix the canopy if just the lower budget is provided.</p><h3>Have you ever received an art grant in the past?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>Have you received funding from any other entity or regional for this piece previously? If so, who and how much and what are you changing? (Having received past funding will not disqualify you if you are using the funds to add to the piece.)</h3>
<p>Yes, I received a little over $450 from Freezerburn to get many of the electronics needed to set up the system in the first place. I also used their funding to add wheel and pedal controllers to the setup, along with purchasing some lights, paint, and a foam base for the track.</p><h3>We may be having the next Ignition Philter fundraiser in Austin in fall of 2025 or spring of 2026. If the piece is still intact, would you be willing/ able to bring the piece to that event? [Or do you have another piece you would like to bring instead?]</h3>
<p>Maybe</p><h3>In 2025-2026 We are hoping the some of the artists can give community workshops outside of Flipside at Lloyd, our Austin workshop. Do you think you have a workshop idea that could be provided to the community? If so, please tell us what it is</h3>
<p>I don't have an idea for a specific workshop at this time, but may think of one.</p>
