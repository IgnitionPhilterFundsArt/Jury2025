            <h3>Description for the Jury: Explain the Project in Full. [This is the description that should explain why the jury should give you the funds so try to answer any questions they might have. Please include some language on how the Flipizens will interact with the piece.]</h3>
<p>
 10 yrs ago,  I  spent many hours working on a costume called MeOwl based on these  photoshopped pics of owls with cat heads.
It rained that entire flip side and having expanding metal wings in lightning is conta-indicated for safety. 

I got the wings to work on the last day of flipside but most of the costume never came together the way I envisioned it.

After this past  election I decided that focusing on more art would be the main way to get threw the now.

When  in Houston I was inspired by the Phoenix Art car .it had the same feather effect I had intended .  I was inspired to go back to the MeOwl concept, but not as a costume.


I feel there is So much going on in the world that we need to howl  about it and Iâ€™m  presenting the idea of a Meaowl Howl Project , the vision is ideally is: 

a 2ft  ft animatronic, motion sensor reactive installation. with an owls body and a cats head it would have a motion sensor vocal/component of different kinds of howls.   and would invite people it senses to howl as well (similar to last years scream  on the effigy).
  I would like to put it up  on a self made cat tree.  Where it would be above people heads  unnoticeable until people walk near it and hear it's howl sound.  eyes light up and wings move.

I would be learning a lot taking on this art project, thankfully I know  friends who are willing work on this with me.
  These are  the ingredients I  am asking  for financial help to help  create this art piece.</p><h3>Application Art</h3>

<p>No</p><h3>If it will need power, what is your power plan?</h3>
<p>self contained battery  power </p><h3>Does the piece incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is it climbable?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>If it does incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is climbable what is your safety plan?  [Note: if flame effects are used, your project will be subject to inspection by the Burnable Art Lead, who has final say if your project will burn during the event.]</h3>
<p>no climbing fire or sparate parts </p><h3>Does this piece already exist?</h3>
<p>Proposed Concept (Not Yet)</p><h3>What is your timeline detailing the planning, creation, installment, and leave no trace removal of your project?</h3>
<p>Prime goal is to make the creature and have it howl at and with people threw a motion sensor element.  Idealy would be to have the wings eyes and head move with illumination.</p><h3>Have you completed any other large scale art projects? Tell us about it/them: (In this media? Where and when? How did the project go? Did you learn any lessons from those projects we should know?)</h3>

<p>Yes</p><h3>In 2025-2026 We are hoping the some of the artists can give community workshops outside of Flipside at Lloyd, our Austin workshop. Do you think you have a workshop idea that could be provided to the community? If so, please tell us what it is</h3>
