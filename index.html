            <h1>Flipside 2025 Ignition Philter Jury Information/Instructions</h1>
            <p>
                <strong>Thank you</strong> again for volunteering to help us make these art decisions.  You've picked an exciting year for it! We have 42 applications which is our highest ever number!
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    Thought Process of how we created the application for you:
                </strong>
                <br />
                - Through the application we have worked to "anonymize" the application so that you as the jury member will be able to judge the art on the piece itself and not the personality of the artist.  Occasionally you'll see something like [artist] or [well trafficked camp]; that is Ignition Philter editing the applications to make them more anonymous.
                That said, we are a small community and sometimes a description or photo (or more often through the description of their past works) may reveal their identity to you. If you can figure out who the artist is, please be objective.  If you feel you can't because you're too close to the person/the piece, please abstain from judging that application.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Money:</strong>
                <br />
                If we funded every project all the money they requested, we would award almost $22,000.
                Sadly, we know we are not going to have that much. Our hope is that we have around $7,000 to award, but won't know the full amount until  Saturday night after ticket opening. Maybe it will be more, maybe less!  (Normally the jury knows this number while doing the pre-grading work but with the month earlier burn everything is happening on a shorter schedule.)  This means that we're not going to be able to fully fund every project, and many projects may not get funding at all.  We ask them for an alternative budget amount for this reason.
            </p>
            <p>
                We have a max of $575 for most projects. We have said that for fantastic projects we would award up to $1000 for 3 projects if the jury thinks that's what should happen.  (There is a world where we do more $1000 grants, but the past jury members have voiced a preference for more art, rather than only awarding 8 pieces funds.)  Ignition Philter has advised the artists a grant will cover only up to 70% of their project costs, so they should show us a budget with all their costs, and should be asking for 70% or less.  Many more than 3 are asking for $1000, so choices will need to be made.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Overall Application Info:</strong>
                <br />
                Read these with an open mind. We aren't just looking for established artists. We're also trying to help create new ones!  It's okay to pick a project that might be a little jankier than another if it makes you feel something.  We hope this first funding grant will encourage more sophisticated projects later!
            </p>
            <p>
                AI: Yes, we do allow ai to be used for their proposal graphics! The inability to draw does not mean you can't build/ create.  The question is: what do you think of the actual project (which cannot use AI).
            </p>
            <p>
                FYI There is no application #15-They decided to drop out of the process

                -You will see there are several projects (applications 39-43) that are multiple parts of a bigger piece.  We allow people to do that with the caveats:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        That each piece could stand on its own as a piece if it was the only one funded
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        That each piece has its own person in charge
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                -You may see some art cars apply.  We do allow art cars to apply if they will be true community vehicles which will give rides to the general public and not just personal/camp transportation.
            </p>
            <p>
                -We do allow food events to apply if it is an event for the public and not just their camp kitchen.
            </p>
            <p>
                -If the piece is not Flame/Movable/Climbable then we do not require a safety plan.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alright-open up those grading spreadsheets and get to judging!
