        <h1>5 - Bathtub Time Machine</h1>
        <hr/>
        <h3>Application Number</h3>
<p></p><h3>Description for the Jury: Explain the Project in Full. [This is the description that should explain why the jury should give you the funds so try to answer any questions they might have. Please include some language on how the Flipizens will interact with the piece.]</h3>
<p>The Bathtub Time Machine is a way station, an invitation to time and space travelers to pause, rest and reset, consider the silly, and reorient themselves within the liminal space of the event. A bathtub is seemingly nothing special when considered in our everyday lives, but taken out of the context of the home and placed as an island in a field, the bathtub becomes a novel mode of transport, taking us to the present moment in an absurd, yet comforting, way.

This piece showers participants in colorful light, while also remaining open to the natural world around and above them, open to the daylight and the night sky. The juxtaposition of lighting cultivates a path between the life of the party and the life of the living universe. Bathers are invited to trigger the flashing lights of time travel upon closing the curtains around them, sending them off into a Wonka-esque tunnel that once stopped, brings them right back to where they began.

The Time Machine is small, just 6'x3', and can be placed anywhere that might catch the wayward traveler's attention. I feel that the effigy field is a wonderful spot for it because of its ability to provide connection or escape to/from the surrounding event. It's also a nice spot to gaze upon the effigy.  First introduced to the community this past weekend at Freezerburn 2025, the flow of people throughout each day and night supported the placement in a space of constant, but not heavy flow of visitors, just beyond the perimeter of the effigy.

The first iteration of this project was simply the tub and shower head. I am requesting funding that will allow me to add a shower curtain (frame, artistic curtain, lights, & power source). This addition will allow for the space to take on a more immersive aspect of time travel. Lights will cover the curtain, surrounding travelers in a world of colorful illumination, suspending the moment in a flood of visual sensation that, once the curtain is pulled back, will leave the traveler refreshed, stepping back into the event from a renewed place and time.</p><h3>Will it need power?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>If it will need power, what is your power plan?</h3>
<p>I would like to use the grant funds for the purchase of a solar powered jackery (specifically the Jackery Portable Power Station Explorer 300), to power a curtain of led lights (specifically the Govee Curtain Lights 2). Here are the links to product information: Jackery https://www.amazon.com/Jackery-Portable-Explorer-Generator-Optional/dp/B082TMBYR6/ref=aa_lpo_d_sccl_3/144-7239432-9727605?pd_rd_w=pFcYh&content-id=amzn1.sym.bee470e4-3434-43b1-aa03-11efbfe8b60c&pf_rd_p=bee470e4-3434-43b1-aa03-11efbfe8b60c&pf_rd_r=X00C6NRXHJE82JAC08GP&pd_rd_wg=juwyj&pd_rd_r=623268f4-8b7f-4b58-8e2e-30963f2d3d2d&pd_rd_i=B082TMBYR6&th=1 []Light Curtain https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Halloween-Christmas-Waterproof-9-8%C3%976-6ft/dp/B0CZ8GKTSD?th=1</p><h3>Does the piece incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is it climbable?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>If it does incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is climbable what is your safety plan?  [Note: if flame effects are used, your project will be subject to inspection by the Burnable Art Lead, who has final say if your project will burn during the event.]</h3>
<p>Climbable in the sense that participants can climb in and out of the bathtub. It is stabilized on two secured metal skates. Moveable parts in the sense that the curtain can be opened or closed around the tub.</p><h3>Does this piece already exist?</h3>
<p>In Progress (Making Changes)</p><h3>What is your timeline detailing the planning, creation, installment, and leave no trace removal of your project?</h3>
<p>The piece is compact and packs down to fit in my 6ft. pickup truck bed. It comes in 5 individual components: 1) Tub, 2) Shower head and pipe, 3) Rectangular Curtain Frame A, 4) Rectangular Curtain Frame B, 5) PVC Circular Curtain Rod and Curtain. Pillows added to tub. Blanket underneath to visually indicate footprint. No loose parts or moop. Plan is to drive the piece to its location on Friday, leave it for the duration of the event, and then load it back out on Monday, using the pick-up truck and the assistance of a couple of friends.</p><h3>Have you completed any other large scale art projects? Tell us about it/them: (In this media? Where and when? How did the project go? Did you learn any lessons from those projects we should know?)</h3>
<p>I have done a few different art projects at past burns over the years. At Flipside 2023, I built (with support from Ignition Philter) a small video projection piece called "Duck: a meditation," which consisted of a projector box, canvas screen w/ metal frame, and a cuddle space of pillows. Participants interacted with it as a quieted space to rest and relax. After the event, I was told that someone had proposed to their partner in front of it! They said "yes" :)

The Time Machine concept has gone through a couple of iterations. My first version of the Bathtub Time Machine was presented on the effigy field at this recent FZB '25 as a simple tub and disco showerhead. I've built another Time Machine that was presented at a fundraiser in the Spring of '24, for the grassroots group Bikes Across Borders, which was constructed around a 1980s exercise bike, propelling participants through time via pedal-power and red wine. 

Other personal projects that I have brought to past burns include: interactive painting projects on public canvases; graffiti walls; body painting; splatter paint spaces; a 4'x9' interactive wishing well with rheoscopic table; animal bone sculpture.

For Freezerburn 2024, I was part of the design/build team for one of the several effigies for that year: The Bamboozled Watcher (aka Speyeder). The piece was impressive, the burn was unforgettable!

In 2018, I was part of the build crew for the Blind Tiger Speakeasy, a much larger art piece than what I have personally done. We built and refurbished the piece for the 2018 Burning Man event, constructing it out in the Black Rock Desert, burning it at the end of the event and transporting the remaining elements back to Austin. This project gave me experience with a larger build, teamwork, and working with the artistic vision of fellow artists.</p><h3>What is the amount you would like to receive? Please enter a dollar amount in this field.</h3>
<p>$575.00</p><h3>Budget</h3>
<p>app 5 budget</p><h3>Alternative Budget-What is the minimum amount that you would need to bring a version of your project? Please provide an alternate dollar amount that will allow the expression of your vision and concept at a reduced scale. The Art Grant budget is limited and this will allow the jury an opportunity to consider funding a lower cost piece instead of passing on it altogether.</h3>
<p>$259</p><h3>Alternative Budget Description (if you would change the piece to match the new budget, please tell us how):</h3>
<p>While funding for both the Jackery and the LED Light Curtain would be wonderful, I can adjust my ambition for the lights, accepting financial support for the power source alone.
*IPH Comment: Wanted the cost of shipping added to the alternative budget number (but both are being purchased on amazon so why is there shipping?)</p><h3>Have you ever received an art grant in the past?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>Have you received funding from any other entity or regional for this piece previously? If so, who and how much and what are you changing? (Having received past funding will not disqualify you if you are using the funds to add to the piece.)</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>We may be having the next Ignition Philter fundraiser in Austin in fall of 2025 or spring of 2026. If the piece is still intact, would you be willing/ able to bring the piece to that event? [Or do you have another piece you would like to bring instead?]</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>In 2025-2026 We are hoping the some of the artists can give community workshops outside of Flipside at Lloyd, our Austin workshop. Do you think you have a workshop idea that could be provided to the community? If so, please tell us what it is</h3>
