        <h3>Application Number</h3>
<p></p><h3>Description for the Jury: Explain the Project in Full. [This is the description that should explain why the jury should give you the funds so try to answer any questions they might have. Please include some language on how the Flipizens will interact with the piece.]</h3>
<p>This is the squishapeed. A mad scientist captured five squishmallows and sewed them together but to mouth. The bodies still intact children's stuffed animals but the legs horrifying monster legs. </p><h3>Will it need power?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>If it will need power, what is your power plan?</h3>
<p>Depending on placement it might just need light </p><h3>Does the piece incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is it climbable?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>If it does incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is climbable what is your safety plan?  [Note: if flame effects are used, your project will be subject to inspection by the Burnable Art Lead, who has final say if your project will burn during the event.]</h3>
<p>** not provided **</p><h3>Does this piece already exist?</h3>
<p>Proposed Concept (Not Yet)</p><h3>What is your timeline detailing the planning, creation, installment, and leave no trace removal of your project?</h3>
<p>Planning... now, last few months 
Creation... weekends in Feb and last weekends in March 
Installment... thursday of flipside </p><h3>Have you completed any other large scale art projects? Tell us about it/them: (In this media? Where and when? How did the project go? Did you learn any lessons from those projects we should know?)</h3>
<p>Not large ones, this would probably be my biggest. I did cuccies critter cages last flipside, i tried to do a radio station a few freezerburns ago .</p><h3>What is the amount you would like to receive? Please enter a dollar amount in this field.</h3>
<p>$360.00</p><h3>Budget</h3>
<p>app-12-budget.jpg</p><h3>Alternative Budget-What is the minimum amount that you would need to bring a version of your project? Please provide an alternate dollar amount that will allow the expression of your vision and concept at a reduced scale. The Art Grant budget is limited and this will allow the jury an opportunity to consider funding a lower cost piece instead of passing on it altogether.</h3>
<p>0</p><h3>Alternative Budget Description (if you would change the piece to match the new budget, please tell us how):</h3>
<p>At this time we have not thought of a cheaper way to bring this creature to life</p><h3>Have you ever received an art grant in the past?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>Have you received funding from any other entity or regional for this piece previously? If so, who and how much and what are you changing? (Having received past funding will not disqualify you if you are using the funds to add to the piece.)</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>We may be having the next Ignition Philter fundraiser in Austin in fall of 2025 or spring of 2026. If the piece is still intact, would you be willing/ able to bring the piece to that event? [Or do you have another piece you would like to bring instead?]</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>In 2025-2026 We are hoping the some of the artists can give community workshops outside of Flipside at Lloyd, our Austin workshop. Do you think you have a workshop idea that could be provided to the community? If so, please tell us what it is</h3>
<p>Not enough spoons at the moment but we do have a woodworker on our team who could potentially do a general Q&A?</p><h3>Application Art</h3>
