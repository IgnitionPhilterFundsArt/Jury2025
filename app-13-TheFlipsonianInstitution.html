            <h3>Description for the Jury: Explain the Project in Full. [This is the description that should explain why the jury should give you the funds so try to answer any questions they might have. Please include some language on how the Flipizens will interact with the piece.]</h3>
<p>The Flipsonian Institution is Pyropolisâ€™ largest and most beloved museum and cultural education complex. We are shaping the future by preserving Flipside heritage. This year our beloved cultural institution will have a Natural ISHtory Museum, a Library of Congress, a precious gem display, and a gift shop.
The Nope Diamond has been recovered and will now have extra security measures to prevent heists! 
The wonders of the ancient ISHian empire will be on special loan to our Museum and we have new evidence of their mysterious disappearance and proof that their decedents walk among us. 
Our world famous gift shop will always have that something special to keep your Flipsonian memories with you.</p><h3>Application Art</h3>

<p>Yes</p><h3>If it will need power, what is your power plan?</h3>
<p>generator</p><h3>Does the piece incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is it climbable?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>If it does incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is climbable what is your safety plan?  [Note: if flame effects are used, your project will be subject to inspection by the Burnable Art Lead, who has final say if your project will burn during the event.]</h3>
<p>** not provided **</p><h3>Does this piece already exist?</h3>
<p>Existing Artwork (it's done, just need help bringing it to Flipside)</p><h3>What is your timeline detailing the planning, creation, installment, and leave no trace removal of your project?</h3>
<p>We have a team of curators that will meet weekly starting this week to work on exhibits. We will need at least 5 people  in for early entry to unload the truck and have all structures erected by Thursday evening and all interiors finished Friday at noon. Breakdown will be be all hands and complete within the normal event times before dark.</p><h3>Have you completed any other large scale art projects? Tell us about it/them: (In this media? Where and when? How did the project go? Did you learn any lessons from those projects we should know?)</h3>

Too many theme camps

Projects have gone lots of ways but we are pretty good at them at this point (don't jinx me) Always have twice as many people scheduled for set up breakdown than you think.  Add 25% higher for any budget you make. It takes 5 people on the ground to safely load and unload and sort materials for a box truck/trailer. Break down the snack/water/ lost and found shade structure last.  Optimization is not the 1st step. Have at least one person there to tell you to eat.  Walk away when you need to cry.

<p>$500.00</p><h3>Budget Spreadsheet</h3>
<p><a href="./budget/app-13-budget.pdf" target="_blank" >app-13-budget.pdf</a></p><h3>Alternative Budget-What is the minimum amount that you would need to bring a version of your project? Please provide an alternate dollar amount that will allow the expression of your vision and concept at a reduced scale. The Art Grant budget is limited and this will allow the jury an opportunity to consider funding a lower cost piece instead of passing on it altogether.</h3>
<p>200</p><h3>Alternative Budget Description (if you would change the piece to match the new budget, please tell us how):</h3>
<p>New budget would just be bringing out already created art but we would still need a truck.</p><h3>Have you ever received an art grant in the past?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>Have you received funding from any other entity or regional for this piece previously? If so, who and how much and what are you changing? (Having received past funding will not disqualify you if you are using the funds to add to the piece.)</h3>
<p>no</p><h3>We may be having the next Ignition Philter fundraiser in Austin in fall of 2025 or spring of 2026. If the piece is still intact, would you be willing/ able to bring the piece to that event? [Or do you have another piece you would like to bring instead?]</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>In 2025-2026 We are hoping the some of the artists can give community workshops outside of Flipside at Lloyd, our Austin workshop. Do you think you have a workshop idea that could be provided to the community? If so, please tell us what it is</h3>
