        <h3>Application Number</h3>
<p></p><h3>Description for the Jury: Explain the Project in Full. [This is the description that should explain why the jury should give you the funds so try to answer any questions they might have. Please include some language on how the Flipizens will interact with the piece.]</h3>
<p>In the spirit of community art I want to setup a floor loom and encourage everybody to contribute to a set of  free form communal tapestries. A table of various art yarns along with non-traditional inclusions such as feathers, flower, etc. will be setup adjacent to it along with instructions. 

While there will be one if not many finished pieces, this project is primarily about the process and act of collaborative creation. I feel this aligns strongly with the burner philosophy and is indirectly related to this year's theme as the diverse people are what I value most in this state.

I find the process to be incredibly relaxing and meditative so it would fit best in a low sound area (or potentially near Sanctuary) there is little someone can do wrong and even mistakes are meant to be embraced as they add to the free form nature of this art style so this is a particularly inclusive interactive piece. The loom will be marked for easy use regardless of the participants' state of mind and body. While there is the bottle neck of only one participant, it can be quite enjoyable to simply watch as well.

Special care would be taken to prevent MOOP with precautions such as  sealed Tupperware and bags for storage, signage, a covered structure, and a tarp. 

Once finished the tapestries would be taken off and hung to either be displayed in a community space and brought to future burns in some form, or alternatively burned with the effigy.

First and foremost the grant would be used for a variety of yarn and materials to ensure there is enough to encourage creative expression and last the entire burn. the grant would would also go towards creating signage to encourage participation and provide instructions.

The loom is the biggest expense currently. I just got one specifically intended for burns, but it is still being paid off on a payment plan. It is an aluminum frame Saori loom that should survive the weather and has several accessibility features so it is more inclusive. While not strictly necessary a larger grant would help pay off the debt on it and provide for repairs should any damage befall it. 

Should it go well, I hope to expand it and offer more forms of fiber art people can help create next year.

</p><h3>Will it need power?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>If it will need power, what is your power plan?</h3>
<p>Small battery powered lights will be hung to enable usage after dark.</p><h3>Does the piece incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is it climbable?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>If it does incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is climbable what is your safety plan?  [Note: if flame effects are used, your project will be subject to inspection by the Burnable Art Lead, who has final say if your project will burn during the event.]</h3>
<p>N/A unlikely to burn. if included with the effigy specal care will be made to use only natural materials.</p><h3>Does this piece already exist?</h3>
<p>In Progress (Making Changes)</p><h3>What is your timeline detailing the planning, creation, installment, and leave no trace removal of your project?</h3>
<p>The loom is being aquired this week. the art supplies will be primarily sourced from enviromentally conscious places like Austin Creative Reuse over the next 3 months and properly sorted and organized to be as accessible as possible. 

I hope to volunteer extensively and have it fully setup between my early shifts by Thursday or Friday morning at the latest. 

As everything is light and portable  removal won't be particularly hard or noteworthy.</p><h3>Have you completed any other large scale art projects? Tell us about it/them: (In this media? Where and when? How did the project go? Did you learn any lessons from those projects we should know?)</h3>
<p>I have been weaving since I was 10, so I feel confident in my ability to instruct and manage that side of the project. 

I have also worked on projects both individually and collaboratively, though this is my first one that is truly planned.

 Most of my projects are process focused rather than the end result so I have little to show. I am currently working on a interactive music gadget for Freezerburn so I have some experience with planing around environmental challenges in a space like this.</p><h3>What is the amount you would like to receive? Please enter a dollar amount in this field.</h3>
<p>$575.00</p><h3>Budget</h3>
<p>app 1 Budget.PDF</p><h3>Alternative Budget-What is the minimum amount that you would need to bring a version of your project? Please provide an alternate dollar amount that will allow the expression of your vision and concept at a reduced scale. The Art Grant budget is limited and this will allow the jury an opportunity to consider funding a lower cost piece instead of passing on it altogether.</h3>
<p>$150</p><h3>Alternative Budget Description (if you would change the piece to match the new budget, please tell us how):</h3>
<p>the $150 would go towards yarn, storage, basic laminated signage. Having a variety of yarn is the biggest direct expense and is important to allow creative color and texture choices.</p><h3>Have you ever received an art grant in the past?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>Have you received funding from any other entity or regional for this piece previously? If so, who and how much and what are you changing? (Having received past funding will not disqualify you if you are using the funds to add to the piece.)</h3>
<p>no previous grants.</p><h3>We may be having the next Ignition Philter fundraiser in Austin in fall of 2025 or spring of 2026. If the piece is still intact, would you be willing/ able to bring the piece to that event? [Or do you have another piece you would like to bring instead?]</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>In 2025-2026 We are hoping the some of the artists can give community workshops outside of Flipside at Lloyd, our Austin workshop. Do you think you have a workshop idea that could be provided to the community? If so, please tell us what it is</h3>
<p>I would love to work towards facilitating a smaller scale weaving workshop with hand looms.</p><h3>Application Art</h3>
