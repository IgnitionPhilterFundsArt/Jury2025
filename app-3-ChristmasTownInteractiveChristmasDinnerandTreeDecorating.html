            <hr/>
            <h3>Description for the Jury: Explain the Project in Full. [This is the description that should explain why the jury should give you the funds so try to answer any questions they might have. Please include some language on how the Flipizens will interact with the piece.]</h3>
<p>Every year Christmas Town hosts an interactive Christmas dinner gathering. We bring smoked chicken, pulled pork, Southern green beans with bacon, mashed potatoes, cornbread hotcakes, and snickerdoodle cookies. Everything is homemade and gluten free. We dress up in our Christmas best and encourage others to wear something Christmas themed to help spread Christmas Cheer! We often have Christmas carols performed by friends from other camps while we are serving food. We normally serve 100-150 people during this one meal, however we also provide breakfast and dinner on the other full days. Christmas dinner is held on Saturday around 5pm. We always have a long line waiting for our delicious feast to be served! During our social gathering and family meal, we
have our real Christmas tree set up to decorate. We provide burn safe blank wooden ornaments with hemp string that can be decorated and hung on our tree. It's a really fun project that we started last year and have done at Flipside and Myschievia. Our tree is burnable art that we throw on the effigy fire once cleared by whoever is in charge.
As one of the few major food camps, providing meals and snacks for literally hundreds of burners each burn, we are requesting assistance from the Art Grant program to help us with these costs and to be able to provide for more people. We often run out before the line is gone. We spend over $1000 on food alone every burn, so any assistance would be greatly appreciated and would certainly get you on the Nice List with Santa!!
Our camp mission is to provide a safe space to eat, lounge, make music, and create magical Christmas memories with our friends and chosen family. Our camp provides Christmas specials and cartoons on our projector in our big comfy lounge area for anyone to come hang out and enjoy each night. We also have live music occasionally and flow performances. Everyone is welcome to dance with us! We understand that Christmas is difficult for many people and for many different reasons. We want to make new memories with you that you will cherish forever. We aim to fill your heart with joy, your tummy with food, and you memories with magic and happiness. We love our community so much and will continue to bring the magic of Christmas to the playa.
Thank you for your consideration! Merry Christmas and Hail Santa!</p><h3>Application Art</h3>
<p><a href="./art/app-3-art-1.jpg" target="_blank" >app-3-art-1.jpg</a></p><p><a href="./art/app-3-art-2.jpg" target="_blank" >app-3-art-2.jpg</a></p><h3>Will it need power?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>If it will need power, what is your power plan?</h3>
<p>We have two generators, a propane grill and, and three propane stoves.</p><h3>Does the piece incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is it climbable?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>If it does incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is climbable what is your safety plan?  [Note: if flame effects are used, your project will be subject to inspection by the Burnable Art Lead, who has final say if your project will burn during the event.]</h3>
<p>N/A</p><h3>Does this piece already exist?</h3>
<p>Proposed Concept (Not Yet)</p><h3>What is your timeline detailing the planning, creation, installment, and leave no trace removal of your project?</h3>
<p>Our community meal will be partially prepared ahead of time and the rest will be cooked on site. Our tree and blank ornaments will be bought just before we head to Flipside so it doesn't die before then. We will leave no trace of food or trash or any form of moop at our camp site or anywhere else on the land. The tree will be burned in the effigy fire. We only allow safe to burn decorations (wood, hemp string, cardboard).</p><h3>Have you completed any other large scale art projects? Tell us about it/them: (In this media? Where and when? How did the project go? Did you learn any lessons from those projects we should know?)</h3>
<p>We have not completed any large scale art projects outside of hosting our interactive Christmas dinner at Myschievia four times and Flipside four times. The execution of our community meal gets better every time we do it. We have learned the best ways to serve lots of people, the fastest and safest ways to prep food ahead of time and prepare food on site. Christmas dinner is always a huge success, feeding around 100-150 people.</p><h3>Past Projects Art</h3>
<p>** not provided **</p><h3>What is the amount you would like to receive? Please enter a dollar amount in this field.</h3>
<p>$575.00</p><h3>Budget Spreadsheet</h3>
<p><a href="./budget/app-3-budget.pdf" target="_blank" >app-3-budget.pdf</a></p><h3>Alternative Budget-What is the minimum amount that you would need to bring a version of your project? Please provide an alternate dollar amount that will allow the expression of your vision and concept at a reduced scale. The Art Grant budget is limited and this will allow the jury an opportunity to consider funding a lower cost piece instead of passing on it altogether.</h3>
<p>$500</p><h3>Alternative Budget Description (if you would change the piece to match the new budget, please tell us how):</h3>
<p>Any amount will help cover the cost of food. We normally spend between $800-$1000 on food, oil, water, and propane for cooking. </p><h3>Have you ever received an art grant in the past?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>Have you received funding from any other entity or regional for this piece previously? If so, who and how much and what are you changing? (Having received past funding will not disqualify you if you are using the funds to add to the piece.)</h3>
<p>We received an art grant of $500 at Myschievia 2024 for our Christmas dinner food fund.</p><h3>We may be having the next Ignition Philter fundraiser in Austin in fall of 2025 or spring of 2026. If the piece is still intact, would you be willing/ able to bring the piece to that event? [Or do you have another piece you would like to bring instead?]</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>In 2025-2026 We are hoping the some of the artists can give community workshops outside of Flipside at Lloyd, our Austin workshop. Do you think you have a workshop idea that could be provided to the community? If so, please tell us what it is</h3>
<p>I don't really have a workshop idea to offer. We cook huge meals for our community.</p>
