            <h3>Description for the Jury: Explain the Project in Full. [This is the description that should explain why the jury should give you the funds so try to answer any questions they might have. Please include some language on how the Flipizens will interact with the piece.]</h3>
<p>The Whirl is the 11-foot diameter merry-go-round, the central component of the Whirl of Art installation. It is built to evoke pure, childlike joy in participants of all ages who get to ride this recreation from times long gone.
Crafting an 11-foot diameter merry-go-round sturdy enough to endure the weight and movement of numerous adults within the confines of a burn landscape presents a myriad of challenges demanding meticulous planning and construction. It is constructed using a 5-ft diameter steel core with wooden extensions on upside down wheels. Central handlebars and outer edge handlebars help participants stay on when it spins. An off-center 10 ft pole is connected to surrounding art installations transferring the motion of the merry-go-round to different components, bringing them to life. As people ride The Whirl, the bat flaps its’ wings (Norturtan Reverie project), Earth-seed opens and closes (TerRa Luna project), hands play the guitar (Capital Chord project), bells ring (Alma de Familia project) and the turtle swims atop a wave (Turtle Tower project).
This marvel is designed not merely as a fun functional element but as a canvas for artistic expression. The center is a colorful abstract representation of “whirl of art” concept. The submerging of colors together creates a still visual representation of movement through a smooth blending of colors. The outer edges of the merry-go-round are set to undergo a transformation akin to the style found in the mesmerizing animations seen on Bonobo's record covers: a series of pictures showing sequential phases of the animation, infusing it with a vibrant tapestry of images representative of each art tower. When the merry-go-round spins these minimal differences between images creates a fluent optical illusion of motion. This type of phenakistoscope design was the first widespread animation device and is regarded as one of the first forms of moving media entertainment that paved the way for the future motion picture and film.
Our merry-go-round rendition The Whirl will harmonize the essence of each towering masterpiece while fostering a sense of whimsy and wonderment among those who engage with it.
</p><h3>Application Art</h3>
<p><a href="./art/app-40-art-1.jpeg" target="_blank" >app-40-art-1.jpeg</a></p><h3>Will it need power?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>If it will need power, what is your power plan?</h3>
<p>All lights used for this installation are solar or battery powered, eliminating the need for a generator. </p><h3>Does the piece incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is it climbable?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>If it does incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is climbable what is your safety plan?  [Note: if flame effects are used, your project will be subject to inspection by the Burnable Art Lead, who has final say if your project will burn during the event.]</h3>
<p>This installation does not incorporate flame effects, but it is a ride and people are expected to get on it and make it turn. Handlebars are installed making it easy to hold on and to push. We plan to inspect all components for safety on a daily basis.
</p><h3>Does this piece already exist?</h3>
<p>In Progress (Making Changes)</p><h3>What is your timeline detailing the planning, creation, installment, and leave no trace removal of your project?</h3>
<p>The tower is partially built, art pieces are being currently worked on. We plan to install all towers the weekend before the event and teardown after. All components will be removed and area swept for MOOP.</p><h3>Have you completed any other large scale art projects? Tell us about it/them: (In this media? Where and when? How did the project go? Did you learn any lessons from those projects we should know?)</h3>
<p>This is my largest art project yet. However I did help create a 16 ft rendition of the Alamo. This taught me that these big projects take a lot of committed time and teamwork. Whirl is a creation of a large group of builders and artists. I am taking on adding the artistic touches and bringing it to Flipside 2025.</p><h3>Past Projects Art</h3>
<p><a href="./past/app-40-past-1.jpeg" target="_blank" >app-40-past-1.jpeg</a></p><h3>What is the amount you would like to receive? Please enter a dollar amount in this field.</h3>
<p>$418.00</p><h3>Budget Spreadsheet</h3>
<p><a href="./budget/app-40-budget.pdf" target="_blank" >app-40-budget.pdf</a></p><h3>Alternative Budget-What is the minimum amount that you would need to bring a version of your project? Please provide an alternate dollar amount that will allow the expression of your vision and concept at a reduced scale. The Art Grant budget is limited and this will allow the jury an opportunity to consider funding a lower cost piece instead of passing on it altogether.</h3>
<p>300</p><h3>Alternative Budget Description (if you would change the piece to match the new budget, please tell us how):</h3>
<p>Overall budget for this project is way more than $1000 and we are attempting to raise these funds privately. It has been a big undertaking and every dollar helps</p><h3>Have you ever received an art grant in the past?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>Have you received funding from any other entity or regional for this piece previously? If so, who and how much and what are you changing? (Having received past funding will not disqualify you if you are using the funds to add to the piece.)</h3>
<p>We received funding from multiple grants, but it covered only a portion of the actual costs. Please see the spreadsheet for cost breakdown.</p><h3>We may be having the next Ignition Philter fundraiser in Austin in fall of 2025 or spring of 2026. If the piece is still intact, would you be willing/ able to bring the piece to that event? [Or do you have another piece you would like to bring instead?]</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>In 2025-2026 We are hoping the some of the artists can give community workshops outside of Flipside at Lloyd, our Austin workshop. Do you think you have a workshop idea that could be provided to the community? If so, please tell us what it is</h3>
<p>Post event this art piece is heading for Burning Man 2025 as a part of Whirl of Art  project. Our team can organize a workshop in 2025 with a panel of artists who have successfully taken projects to Burning Man in the past talking about the process, funding, project management, successes and pitfalls.
