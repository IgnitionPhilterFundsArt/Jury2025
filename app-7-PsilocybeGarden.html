            <hr/>
            <h3>Description for the Jury: Explain the Project in Full. [This is the description that should explain why the jury should give you the funds so try to answer any questions they might have. Please include some language on how the Flipizens will interact with the piece.]</h3>
<p>‚ÄòPsilocybe Garden‚Äô is my immersive experience ‚Äúhippie-trap‚Äù for lack of a better word. The main sculpture is a 9ft tall Bluetooth-controlled LED mushroom, (a Psilocybe Cubensis to be exact, thus the camp name.) 
The mushroom sculpture is surrounded by a 20ft circular ‚Äúcuddle pit‚Äù for comfortable viewing at every angle, (also chairs available for anyone with mobility issues, or just doesn‚Äôt want to take their shoes off to lay down!) 
The cuddle pit is crafted with green dyed fabrics/handmade pillows/green shag carpet to emphasize the effect that you‚Äôre inches tall, laying in a bed of moss surrounded by fungi. It‚Äôs hard not to lounge for hours getting lost in the music while enjoying our mini-bar of delicious elixirs and snacks served by strange creatures and mushroom fae.
The more you look around you in the garden, the more little details you‚Äôll see. Best example is the hidden door on the largest mushroom in the center, reach inside for a present! (Not to spoil the surprise, but it‚Äôs a tiny resin glow-in-the-dark mushroom. One of many trinkets within the garden, I won‚Äôt spoil the rest for you.)
As well, as an homage to Alice in Wonderland, at the camps entrance there‚Äôs a mysterious shimmering liquid (edible glitter and Gatorade) labeled ‚ÄúDrink Me‚Äù to ‚Äòshrink you down to size,‚Äô (pictured in graphics below) and a table with candies labeled ‚ÄúEat Me‚Äù by the exit to ‚Äòreturn to normal size.‚Äô 

Psilocybe is a space created by my love of a comfortable place to sit with something beautiful to look at. I‚Äôve been told the Garden is a great spot to go when you need to take a break and recharge, but you don‚Äôt want to stop the party. There‚Äôs more than music and good conversation, there‚Äôs things to do sitting under the mushroom, free use items, instruments, sensory playthings, gifts and trinkets to take with you. People gather at all times of day here, for meditation in the mornings, musicians flock to our afternoon open jam seshes and the daily ‚Äòlight-up‚Äô to turn on the sculpture at dusk, all the way late into the night telling stories of the evening‚Äôs adventures, impromptu singalongs, or just gazing at the mushroom until sunrise enjoying the ambient music and soft sounds we play on our speakers. It‚Äôs a multi-faceted space that changes completely depending on the energy of who‚Äôs occupying it.</p><h3>Application Art</h3>

<p>Yes</p><h3>If it will need power, what is your power plan?</h3>
<p>Generator</p><h3>Does the piece incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is it climbable?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>If it does incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is climbable what is your safety plan?  [Note: if flame effects are used, your project will be subject to inspection by the Burnable Art Lead, who has final say if your project will burn during the event.]</h3>
<p>** not provided **</p><h3>Does this piece already exist?</h3>
<p>Existing Artwork (it's done, just need help bringing it to Flipside)</p><h3>What is your timeline detailing the planning, creation, installment, and leave no trace removal of your project?</h3>
<p>Since the project is already created, (minus minor adjustments/embellishments that should take me no more than a week) the transportation timeline is for late March/early April (my partner lives in HTX, so after arrival, I‚Äôll store the sculpture/camp in his garage before/after Flipside until my return back to NH.)
 
Installment takes about 6-7 hours going at a relaxed pace with myself and my partner. At our last burn with a team of 4 we got everything up in under 3 hours. 
Full pack up, load out, and LNT probably takes about 5-6 hours total with a team of 4. (7-8 with just my partner and I)

Traditionally myself, my partner, and my build crew will set up during early arrival and then grab a couple volunteer shifts until it‚Äôs time for gates to open.</p><h3>Have you completed any other large scale art projects? Tell us about it/them: (In this media? Where and when? How did the project go? Did you learn any lessons from those projects we should know?)</h3>
<p>I‚Äôve set up plenty of my own smaller works, had a hand in others projects and been on numerous on-site labor teams and effigy builds, but 2024 was my first year making something large of my own design. (I‚Äôm a lifelong mixed-media artist, this was my biggest project yet.)
I submitted my proposal to Firefly in VT in January last year, I completed and debuted it at the event in July, it went better than I could have ever imagined, and since then, an entire theme camp has quickly grown around this art! Much like a fast-growing fungi üçÑ
The big lesson I learned from my experience with my project was ‚Äúwriting a budget‚Äù for a grant does not mean try to ‚Äúoverly bargain hunt budget.‚Äù As a low-income individual, it‚Äôs become natural to do everything in the most cost-effective manner possible, it‚Äôs how I live my life! I learned the hard way when writing a budget outline for artwork, the goal is to leave room for extra expenses (I would not have gone so over-budget on Psilocybe Garden originally if I hadn‚Äôt presented a proposal saying ‚Äúlook how in-expensive it would be to make this!‚Äù) Just ask for the help you need! That‚Äôs the reason systems like this exist.

More importantly though were lessons I learned working under others projects. It reminds me the way to lead is by example. Every crew is only as good as its leader. Simple as it is, just treat others how you want to be treated. </p><h3>Past Projects Art</h3>

Please enter a dollar amount in this field.</h3>
<p>$500.00 </p><h3>Budget Spreadsheet</h3>
<p><a href="./budget/app-7-budget.pdf" target="_blank" >app-7-budget.pdf</a></p><h3>Alternative Budget-What is the minimum amount that you would need to bring a version of your project? Please provide an alternate dollar amount that will allow the expression of your vision and concept at a reduced scale. The Art Grant budget is limited and this will allow the jury an opportunity to consider funding a lower cost piece instead of passing on it altogether.</h3>
<p>$350 </p><h3>Alternative Budget Description (if you would change the piece to match the new budget, please tell us how):</h3>
<p>I added sidenotes detailing the alternative budget in my spreadsheet, essentially with a smaller budget the funds would be focused on aiding sculptures transportation and necessities. 
(Round trip sculpture transportation from NH to TX costs average $550 in gas in my partners truck (26 hour drive each way) </p><h3>Have you ever received an art grant in the past?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>Have you received funding from any other entity or regional for this piece previously? If so, who and how much and what are you changing? (Having received past funding will not disqualify you if you are using the funds to add to the piece.)</h3>
<p>Yes, Psilocybe Garden only exists thanks to the grant system! As I mentioned, I initially submitted my proposal and project outline to Firefly VT for a grant of $599, went slightlyyy over-budget (almost $200 over from my own wallet) but who‚Äôs counting! 
Since then, I applied for a mini-grant of $75 for Nectr CT to repair some water-damaged lighting from the last burn (there was a flash thunderstorm at Firefly) as well as some cleaning supplies for the projects aftercare. And most recently, I‚Äôve been granted $200 towards gas/transportation, and granted 4 artist tickets for myself and my build crew to drive my sculpture from New Hampshire to Loveburn in February. I‚Äôm incredibly thankful to this system, there is NO WAY I could afford to bring my sculpture across the country without this kind of assistance.
I would be truly honored to make Burning Flipside part of the history of it‚Äôs first year (we‚Äôll be celebrating Psilocybe‚Äôs anniversary in July!!)</p><h3>We may be having the next Ignition Philter fundraiser in Austin in fall of 2025 or spring of 2026. If the piece is still intact, would you be willing/ able to bring the piece to that event? [Or do you have another piece you would like to bring instead?]</h3>
<p>Maybe</p><h3>In 2025-2026 We are hoping the some of the artists can give community workshops outside of Flipside at Lloyd, our Austin workshop. Do you think you have a workshop idea that could be provided to the community? If so, please tell us what it is</h3>
<p>I don‚Äôt have a particular idea at this moment, but I could definitely brainstorm a workshop! Beyond the methods and materials I used on my sculpture, there‚Äôs a ton of creative designs I‚Äôd love to share with the community!</p>
