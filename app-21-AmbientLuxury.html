        <h3>Description for the Jury: Explain the Project in Full. [This is the description that should explain why the jury should give you the funds so try to answer any questions they might have. Please include some language on how the Flipizens will interact with the piece.]</h3>
<p>I'm revisiting an art piece concept I did back in 2018 for FS. I get an antique window and then do a stained glass mosaic over the top of it. I then cut out a backing board for the window, and make an LED matrix on it, add a diffusion layer, attach a chain, and hang from a hammock chair stand. The window looks like it is floating and catches all the hippies. I plan to have a small speaker playing the finest of ambient music. Like challenging ambient music, not just downtempo. I plan on having a few push buttons on hand that can trigger some different patterns on the piece, some of which will be sound reactive. I would hang this new piece beside the one I did in 2018--which is shown in the photo I included. Ultimately, I'd like to have six or eight of these windows so I can make a glowing stained glass room at Flipside. </p><h3>Application Art</h3>
<p><a href="./art/app-21-art-1.png" target="_blank" >app-21-art-1.png</a></p><h3>Will it need power?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>If it will need power, what is your power plan?</h3>
<p>Running entirely off of battery. </p><h3>Does the piece incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is it climbable?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>If it does incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is climbable what is your safety plan?  [Note: if flame effects are used, your project will be subject to inspection by the Burnable Art Lead, who has final say if your project will burn during the event.]</h3>
<p>** not provided **</p><h3>Does this piece already exist?</h3>
<p>Proposed Concept (Not Yet)</p><h3>What is your timeline detailing the planning, creation, installment, and leave no trace removal of your project?</h3>
<p>Shopping for windows now. Already sourced hammock stand. Art grant (if any) well help me determine budget for stained glass. I've got a general idea of how I'd like the piece to look. It goes quickly once I start cutting glass. I've already got the controller for the led matrixes. I may need to buy some LEDs. I use weather proof glue for the stained glass and didn't have any issues with my prior piece. I will put the piece on a rug so if any do happen to fall off, they will be caught and not lost in the dirt. </p><h3>Have you completed any other large scale art projects? Tell us about it/them: (In this media? Where and when? How did the project go? Did you learn any lessons from those projects we should know?)</h3>
<p>Yes. I did the stained glass window for FS 2018. For FS 2019, I did, "Usually Existence Conceals Itself," which was a large project on the effigy field. Both went well. I learned how to find some helpful people to assist with the projects. I also figured out what sort of scope of project I can confidently pull off. </p><h3>Past Projects Art</h3>
<p><a href="./past/app-21-past-1.jpeg" target="_blank" >app-21-past-1.jpeg</a></p><p><a href="./past/app-21-past-2.jpeg" target="_blank" >app-21-past-2.jpeg</a></p><p><a href="./past/app-21-past-3.jpeg" target="_blank" >app-21-past-3.jpeg</a></p><p><a href="./past/app-21-past.jpeg" target="_blank" >app-21-past.jpeg</a></p><h3>What is the amount you would like to receive? Please enter a dollar amount in this field.</h3>
<p>$200.00</p><h3>Budget Spreadsheet</h3>
<p><a href="./budget/app-21-budget.pdf" target="_blank" >app-21-budget.pdf</a></p><h3>Alternative Budget-What is the minimum amount that you would need to bring a version of your project? Please provide an alternate dollar amount that will allow the expression of your vision and concept at a reduced scale. The Art Grant budget is limited and this will allow the jury an opportunity to consider funding a lower cost piece instead of passing on it altogether.</h3>
<p>$100</p><h3>Alternative Budget Description (if you would change the piece to match the new budget, please tell us how):</h3>
<p>It would be mostly the same, though I may prioritize using glass scraps which limits what I can do. </p><h3>Have you ever received an art grant in the past?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>Have you received funding from any other entity or regional for this piece previously? If so, who and how much and what are you changing? (Having received past funding will not disqualify you if you are using the funds to add to the piece.)</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>We may be having the next Ignition Philter fundraiser in Austin in fall of 2025 or spring of 2026. If the piece is still intact, would you be willing/ able to bring the piece to that event? [Or do you have another piece you would like to bring instead?]</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>In 2025-2026 We are hoping the some of the artists can give community workshops outside of Flipside at Lloyd, our Austin workshop. Do you think you have a workshop idea that could be provided to the community? If so, please tell us what it is</h3>
<p>No ideas at the moment. </p>
