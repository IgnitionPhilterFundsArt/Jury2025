            <h3>Description for the Jury: Explain the Project in Full. [This is the description that should explain why the jury should give you the funds so try to answer any questions they might have. Please include some language on how the Flipizens will interact with the piece.]</h3>
<p>Drawn to Light is a cozy, creative sanctuary where Flipizens can gather, vibe, and let their artistic energy flow. Centered around a low table surrounded by a plethora of cushioned pillows, this chill zone invites folks to craft decorative church fans—both a cool tool for the Texas heat and a tangible expression of their inner spark—or simply kick back, soak in the mellow ambiance, and bask in the ever-changing dance of light and sound.

The heart of this piece is the lighting, alive with motion and connection. It responds to your presence, reflecting the energy of those who enter the space and illuminating the shared creative pulse of the moment.

As Flipizens create, their handmade fans will weave into the fabric of the installation, transforming the space into an ever-evolving tapestry of art, intention, and togetherness. Every fan tells a story, every piece adds to the collective energy, and by the end of the event, the installation becomes a beautiful reminder of the community’s shared journey.

Why fund Drawn to Light?  This installation embodies the soul of Flipside: creativity, connection, and celebration of the here and now. It’s a welcoming, come-as-you-are space that encourages folks to co-create and find harmony in the act of making and being. Whether someone’s crafting, chilling, or just passing through, this installation is a moment of shared magic that everyone can feel a part of.

The funding will fuel this vision, providing everything from groovy interactive lighting tech to rad materials for crafting and comfy cushions to sink into. It’s all about creating a space that feels inclusive, intentional, and full of good vibes.  Not only a sight to experience, Drawn to Light is an interactive art installation with an open invitation to share, create, and be a part of something luminous and unforgettable.</p><h3>Application Art</h3>
<p><a href="./art/app-37-art-1.png" target="_blank" >app-37-art-1.png</a></p><h3>Will it need power?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>If it will need power, what is your power plan?</h3>
<p>Minimal power, but it will need power. Lighting: Use of low-power LED strips or panels for interactive lighting. LEDs consume minimal power and can be easily wired to a battery with a small controller for the interactive elements. Sound System: Small Bluetooth speakers or compact sound units can also be powered by the same system.</p><h3>Does the piece incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is it climbable?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>If it does incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is climbable what is your safety plan?  [Note: if flame effects are used, your project will be subject to inspection by the Burnable Art Lead, who has final say if your project will burn during the event.]</h3>
<p>Moveable pieces will only be a very small, low powered motor that rotates lines of string (the moveable part will be rotating church fans which are made from popsicle sticks and paper, very lightweight.)  Safety plan for this is to use a low power motor, have a cutoff switch, and to place barriers around the motorized parts. </p><h3>Does this piece already exist?</h3>
<p>In Progress (Making Changes)</p><h3>What is your timeline detailing the planning, creation, installment, and leave no trace removal of your project?</h3>
<p>2 Months before Flipside: 
• Finalize the concept design, determine budget
• Build and test a small-scale prototype, including lighting, motor, and crafting components.
• Purchase supplies, coordinate transportation, and prep tools for setup.
1 Month before Flipside: 
• Construct the table, assemble the lighting and motor elements, and create sample fans.
• Test the full setup to ensure interactive functionality, battery life and safety.
Flipside: 
• Set up all components onsite, test interactivity, and prepare for flipizens.
• Guide flipizens in crafting fans, participate and monitor the installation, and maintain safety.
End of event: 
• Disassemble the installation, pack materials, and clean the site to leave no trace.
• Store reusable items, recycle materials, and document the project for future endeavors.</p><h3>Have you completed any other large scale art projects? Tell us about it/them: (In this media? Where and when? How did the project go? Did you learn any lessons from those projects we should know?)</h3>
<p>
Yes, I’ve completed large-scale murals in my micrography style, where detailed text creates larger images. These projects required careful planning to balance intricate details with visual impact from afar and taught me the importance of flexibility and embracing creative flow. Through these experiences, I’ve honed my ability to manage large projects, adapt my style to scale, and create meaningful connections through art.</p><h3>Past Projects Art</h3>
<p><a href="./past/app-37-past-1.jpg" target="_blank" >app-37-past-1.jpg</a></p><h3>What is the amount you would like to receive? Please enter a dollar amount in this field.</h3>
<p>$575.00</p><h3>Budget Spreadsheet</h3>
<p><a href="./budget/app-37-budget.pdf" target="_blank" >app-37-budget.pdf</a></p><h3>Alternative Budget-What is the minimum amount that you would need to bring a version of your project? Please provide an alternate dollar amount that will allow the expression of your vision and concept at a reduced scale. The Art Grant budget is limited and this will allow the jury an opportunity to consider funding a lower cost piece instead of passing on it altogether.</h3>
<p>575</p><h3>Alternative Budget Description (if you would change the piece to match the new budget, please tell us how):</h3>
<p>Lighting Equipment ($150): Purchase LED strips or panels and interactive lighting components. Crafting Supplies ($100): Materials for creating church fans, like popsicle sticks, paper, glue, and other tools. Motor and Power System ($125): Small, low-power motor for the rotating fan mechanism, plus a portable battery or power station for powering the installation. Seating and Pillows ($100): Comfortable, durable pillows for seating around the table. Sound System ($50): Compact speakers to play ambient sounds. Miscellaneous and Contingencies ($50): Extra supplies, safety materials, or unanticipated costs.</p><h3>Have you ever received an art grant in the past?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>Have you received funding from any other entity or regional for this piece previously? If so, who and how much and what are you changing? (Having received past funding will not disqualify you if you are using the funds to add to the piece.)</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>We may be having the next Ignition Philter fundraiser in Austin in fall of 2025 or spring of 2026. If the piece is still intact, would you be willing/ able to bring the piece to that event? [Or do you have another piece you would like to bring instead?]</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>In 2025-2026 We are hoping the some of the artists can give community workshops outside of Flipside at Lloyd, our Austin workshop. Do you think you have a workshop idea that could be provided to the community? If so, please tell us what it is</h3>
<p>Yes!  I can do all sorts of art workshops (I am an art educator)</p>
