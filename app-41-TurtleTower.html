            <h3>Description for the Jury: Explain the Project in Full. [This is the description that should explain why the jury should give you the funds so try to answer any questions they might have. Please include some language on how the Flipizens will interact with the piece.]</h3>
<p>"Turtle Tower" is a captivating and environmentally conscious art piece thoughtfully designed by a dedicated team from Corpus Christi, Texas. The sculpture takes the form of a giant turtle, being carried by a wave. The turtle itself is designed to be built out of plywood and assembled like playa-tech furniture with limited use of screws and glue. The merry-go-round's motion is connected to the turtle's fins, causing it to undulate gracefully, creating an enchanting illusion of the turtle swimming through the waves.  
All five of the sea turtle species found in the Gulf of Mexico rely on Corpus Christi beaches and adjacent waters. Kemp's ridley sea turtles, an endangered species, nest on North Padre Island more than at any other location in the United States.  For the last 10 years Corpus Christi burners have been organizing beach cleanups, four times a year to create safe environment for them to reproduce.  The "Turtle Tower" project is designed not just as a testament to artistic creativity but also to embody burners’ commitment to Corpus Christi's beaches. 
The outer shell of the base is adorned with intricate artistic works cut and burned into the wood and paint-stained in pastel colors. While three of the sides express the beauty and the joy that Corpus Christi's beaches and the ocean bring to people, one wall focuses on the negative impact we as humans have on the environment. 
Inside the base visitors are welcomed into a beach-themed oasis. The space is adorned with various art pieces created by local artists, each telling a unique story of the coast, from vibrant seascapes to delicate seashell sculptures. Soft, melodic sounds of waves crashing against the shore fill the air are added to the sound of the seashells wind chimes, creating a soothing and immersive experience. It's as if the sea has been brought indoors, with the gentle rhythms of the tides providing a backdrop to the art gallery. Hammocks are hanging in each corner inviting visitors to linger and enjoy the peacefulness.
During the nighttime, the "Turtle Tower" will come alive with a symphony of colors and shadows. The bright outline of the turtle, soft glow from the inside and the play of lights with ocean effect on its surface adds a dynamic and mesmerizing dimension to the sculpture. The lighting in the base is a sight to behold: LED tiki torches cast a warm and inviting flickering glow at the entrances, while the projected ocean waves dance on the ground, adding a dynamic and surreal touch to the space. On the outside, the lights shine through the carving while the wave lights bathe the paintings with a soft glow.
Visitors to the "Turtle Tower" will undoubtedly be inspired by its beauty, both in the daylight and the night's enchanting glow. It serves as a testament to the harmony that can be achieved when art and nature intertwine, delivering a powerful message that transcends traditional boundaries and encourages all to be protectors of our cherished coastal environments, even in the moonlit hours.
</p><h3>Application Art</h3>
<p><a href="./art/app-41-art-1.jpeg" target="_blank" >app-41-art-1.jpeg</a></p><p><a href="./art/app-41-art-2.jpeg" target="_blank" >app-41-art-2.jpeg</a></p><h3>Will it need power?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>If it will need power, what is your power plan?</h3>
<p>All lights used for this installation are solar or battery powered, eliminating the need for a generator. </p><h3>Does the piece incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is it climbable?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>If it does incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is climbable what is your safety plan?  [Note: if flame effects are used, your project will be subject to inspection by the Burnable Art Lead, who has final say if your project will burn during the event.]</h3>
<p>This installation does not incorporate flame effects and is not climbable, however it contains moving pieces activated by the nearby merry-go-round. All moving parts are at least 9’ off the ground and outside people’s reach.</p><h3>Does this piece already exist?</h3>
<p>Proposed Concept (Not Yet)</p><h3>What is your timeline detailing the planning, creation, installment, and leave no trace removal of your project?</h3>
<p>Design has been finalized and we are now working on details. The build will commence as soon as we receive funds for materials. All pieces will be pre-cut, sanded and painted as needed, pre-assembled in large sections, and checked to ensure they fit together during the pre-Flipside build. We expect to need 2-3 build days on the land before opening it to visitors. We expect to need 1.5 days to carefully disassemble and transport off the property. Project will bring moop-buckets and moop-sticks to be used for daily de-mooping, as well as for post event cleanup.</p><h3>Have you completed any other large scale art projects? Tell us about it/them: (In this media? Where and when? How did the project go? Did you learn any lessons from those projects we should know?)</h3>
<p>This is my largest art project yet. However I was the Effigy Lead for the 2018 Beachside burn  “Blaze Well With Others” and effigy builder for multiple Beach burns 2016-2024.</p><h3>Past Projects Art</h3>
<p><a href="./past/app-41-past-1.jpeg" target="_blank" >app-41-past-1.jpeg</a></p><h3>What is the amount you would like to receive? Please enter a dollar amount in this field.</h3>
<p>$1,000.00</p><h3>Budget Spreadsheet</h3>
<p><a href="./budget/app-41-budget.pdf" target="_blank" >app-41-budget.pdf</a></p><h3>Alternative Budget-What is the minimum amount that you would need to bring a version of your project? Please provide an alternate dollar amount that will allow the expression of your vision and concept at a reduced scale. The Art Grant budget is limited and this will allow the jury an opportunity to consider funding a lower cost piece instead of passing on it altogether.</h3>
<p>575</p><h3>Alternative Budget Description (if you would change the piece to match the new budget, please tell us how):</h3>
<p>Overall budget for this project is way more than $1000 and we are attempting to raise these funds privately. It has been a big undertaking and every dollar helps</p><h3>Have you ever received an art grant in the past?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>Have you received funding from any other entity or regional for this piece previously? If so, who and how much and what are you changing? (Having received past funding will not disqualify you if you are using the funds to add to the piece.)</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>We may be having the next Ignition Philter fundraiser in Austin in fall of 2025 or spring of 2026. If the piece is still intact, would you be willing/ able to bring the piece to that event? [Or do you have another piece you would like to bring instead?]</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>In 2025-2026 We are hoping the some of the artists can give community workshops outside of Flipside at Lloyd, our Austin workshop. Do you think you have a workshop idea that could be provided to the community? If so, please tell us what it is</h3>
<p>We intend to keep outer walls of the pedestal and combine them with walls from other components to make another art piece that can be displayed at Ignition Philter fundraiser in the spring of 2026

Post event this art piece is heading for Burning Man 2025 as a part of Whirl of Art  project. Our team can organize a workshop in 2025 with a panel of artists who have successfully taken projects to Burning Man in the past talking about the process, funding, project management, successes and pitfalls.
