            <h1>31 - Bossa Nova Bocce Bacchanal</h1>
            <hr/>
            <h3>Description for the Jury: Explain the Project in Full. [This is the description that should explain why the jury should give you the funds so try to answer any questions they might have. Please include some language on how the Flipizens will interact with the piece.]</h3>
<p>The work will give burners a 24 hour outlet for their excess energies and a chance to improve the hand eye coordination. By day, BBNB will be a reduce-sized bocce court. By night, it will be in its full, prismatic glory with light-up bocce balls, sound reactive lights around the court, and a photo-reactive court surface. And during select hours, the court will be manned by a staff of crotchety old Italian men serving Amaros and rich black coffee with bossa nova melodies.

In less poetic terms, during the day it will be a normal bocce court. At night, we will super charge it with blinky lights that sync with nearby sound sources. And for one special hour a day, a couple of team members will dress up as old Italian guys and serve the hippies coffee and herbal Italian liqueurs.   </p><h3>Application Art</h3>

<p>Yes</p><h3>If it will need power, what is your power plan?</h3>
<p>I would like to place the project near Lava Lounge. They have agreed to provide power to the project.</p><h3>Does the piece incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is it climbable?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>If it does incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is climbable what is your safety plan?  [Note: if flame effects are used, your project will be subject to inspection by the Burnable Art Lead, who has final say if your project will burn during the event.]</h3>
<p>n/a</p><h3>Does this piece already exist?</h3>
<p>In Progress (Making Changes)</p><h3>What is your timeline detailing the planning, creation, installment, and leave no trace removal of your project?</h3>
<p>I have a simple version of the project ready today, which had some limited use at Freezerburn as an unofficial art project. That soft launch was helpful. I now better understand what kind of land is need for the project. 

In March, I plan to increase the size of the court from 32' to 48' long. I also plan to replace the current "dumb" lights with sound reactive lights and set up audio inputs. Lastly, I will create a plan for the special "bossa nova power hours". I will need to recruit to more people to cos-play as crotchety old Italian men imported straight from Puglia and make plans for the espresso and Amoro menu. 

I will finish building the project by early April, then disassemble it and get it ready to take to Flipside. I need to figure out a plan to transport it to the land. I am hoping I can borrow space in some camp's truck or trailer or with a burner. I would like to get early entry to Flipside so that I can assemble the project on Wednesday and the connect it to Lava Lounge's power system on Thursday. Assembly should take about 3 - 4 hours. I am planning for Bossa Nova power hours between 8 - 9pm Thursday - Sunday. Taking the project apart should take about 2 hours. I will load it out the same way I bring the project in. 
   </p><h3>Have you completed any other large scale art projects? Tell us about it/them: (In this media? Where and when? How did the project go? Did you learn any lessons from those projects we should know?)</h3>
<p>While in grad school a colleague and I created a project called "The House for Story Tellers". It was a guerilla art installation that we constructed, used, and removed in 14 hours in a traffic median in the middle of I-75/85 in downtown Atlanta. We cross 10 lanes of traffic with our tools and materials, built the house, built a camp fire, exchanged stories, took apart the house, remove all trace (including the ashes) and left. An important lesson learned is that fire is a pain the ass to clean up. A second important lesson is that your professors will love when you interpret a "digital project" as something you do with your hands and not in Photoshop and your annoying classmates will be super pissy about it.

I have already built a first, preliminary version of the project. </p><h3>Past Projects Art</h3>
<p>** not provided **</p><h3>What is the amount you would like to receive? Please enter a dollar amount in this field.</h3>
<p>$556.00 </p><h3>Budget Spreadsheet</h3>
<p><a href="./budget/app-31-budget.pdf" target="_blank" >app-31-budget.pdf</a></p><h3>Alternative Budget-What is the minimum amount that you would need to bring a version of your project? Please provide an alternate dollar amount that will allow the expression of your vision and concept at a reduced scale. The Art Grant budget is limited and this will allow the jury an opportunity to consider funding a lower cost piece instead of passing on it altogether.</h3>
<p>$200 </p><h3>Alternative Budget Description (if you would change the piece to match the new budget, please tell us how):</h3>
<p>I would add fewer lights to the project and not increase the size of the initial test version.</p><h3>Have you ever received an art grant in the past?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>Have you received funding from any other entity or regional for this piece previously? If so, who and how much and what are you changing? (Having received past funding will not disqualify you if you are using the funds to add to the piece.)</h3>
<p>No.</p><h3>We may be having the next Ignition Philter fundraiser in Austin in fall of 2025 or spring of 2026. If the piece is still intact, would you be willing/ able to bring the piece to that event? [Or do you have another piece you would like to bring instead?]</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>In 2025-2026 We are hoping the some of the artists can give community workshops outside of Flipside at Lloyd, our Austin workshop. Do you think you have a workshop idea that could be provided to the community? If so, please tell us what it is</h3>
<p>Maybe? I like the idea of talking about how to build simple, temporary structures and using ritual to make them seem like more. I haven't thought about that much yet. 

I can also see a talk about how to be organized and structured while also being creative so that artists actually finish their stuff on time (or close to it) and organize helpers effectively.</p>
