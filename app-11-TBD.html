        <h3>Description for the Jury: Explain the Project in Full. [This is the description that should explain why the jury should give you the funds so try to answer any questions they might have. Please include some language on how the Flipizens will interact with the piece.]</h3>
<p>The past two years, I've had the privilege of bringing a large wooden sculpture to Flipside. This sculpture is titled "Channeled" and was carved from a single piece of cedar using a chainsaw and angle grinder with flap disks. Channeled debuted FS 2023 and was placed on the effigy field. In 2024, Channeled made her home on art island. I would love to bring a new sculpture to Flipside 2025, also carved from a large cedar stump. My style is abstract, largely determined by feeling and flowing with my material. I'm not sure exactly what my new sculpture will look like and therefore don't yet have a name for it, but I imagine it will have a similar vibe as Channeled (though hopefully with more exploration with negative space and shapes) As with Channeled, my hope is that the sculpture can be something that encourages people to take a few moments to touch and feel the sculpture, maybe have a seat next to and get lost in the flow. I also love to make sure the cedar sculpture is lit up at night with color-changing effects to enhance and create new shapes that give the viewer a different feel than daylight viewing. Please note, since this is an organic TBD kind of art, I don't have any renderings of what it will look like. But for images, I've included pics of Channeled (day + night w/ lights) and another, smaller oak sculpture of mine to give ya'll a feel for my style. I've also included photos of the new, raw cedar stump that is waiting for me to get cracking. </p><h3>Application Art</h3>
<p><a href="./art/app-11-art-4.jpeg" target="_blank" >app-11-art-4.jpeg</a></p><h3>Will it need power?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>If it will need power, what is your power plan?</h3>
<p>The past two years, Art Support has helped place me near projects with generators. If this isn't possible this year, I'll bring my own power solution.</p><h3>Does the piece incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is it climbable?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>If it does incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is climbable what is your safety plan?  [Note: if flame effects are used, your project will be subject to inspection by the Burnable Art Lead, who has final say if your project will burn during the event.]</h3>
<p>** not provided **</p><h3>Does this piece already exist?</h3>
<p>Proposed Concept (Not Yet)</p><h3>What is your timeline detailing the planning, creation, installment, and leave no trace removal of your project?</h3>
<p>Material has been acquired. I will begin sculpting this piece next week and will be sculpting my heart out until Flipside (14ish weeks)! Will ensure the piece is either on the community truck or stowed personally and is off land by GTFO time, as well as that any sculpture moop (hopefully none because there shouldn't be unless something goes wrong)  is taken care of in that process.</p><h3>Have you completed any other large scale art projects? Tell us about it/them: (In this media? Where and when? How did the project go? Did you learn any lessons from those projects we should know?)</h3>
<p>Oops, I already answered this question in the first portion of the application - yes, I've brought a large cedar sculpture named Channeled the past two Flipsides. Lessons learned were about having a more solid plan for power since last year I wasn't able to get power for night lights until Saturday night. Loved watching people interact with and relax next to it, both on the effigy field and art island. I'd like to include some blankets or pillows maybe for around the sculpture this year.</p><h3>Past Projects Art</h3>

<p><a href="./budget/app-11-budget.pdf" target="_blank" >app-11-budget.pdf</a></p><h3>Alternative Budget-What is the minimum amount that you would need to bring a version of your project? Please provide an alternate dollar amount that will allow the expression of your vision and concept at a reduced scale. The Art Grant budget is limited and this will allow the jury an opportunity to consider funding a lower cost piece instead of passing on it altogether.</h3>
<p>$150</p><h3>Alternative Budget Description (if you would change the piece to match the new budget, please tell us how):</h3>
<p>n/a</p><h3>Have you ever received an art grant in the past?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>Have you received funding from any other entity or regional for this piece previously? If so, who and how much and what are you changing? (Having received past funding will not disqualify you if you are using the funds to add to the piece.)</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>We may be having the next Ignition Philter fundraiser in Austin in fall of 2025 or spring of 2026. If the piece is still intact, would you be willing/ able to bring the piece to that event? [Or do you have another piece you would like to bring instead?]</h3>
<p>Maybe</p><h3>In 2025-2026 We are hoping the some of the artists can give community workshops outside of Flipside at Lloyd, our Austin workshop. Do you think you have a workshop idea that could be provided to the community? If so, please tell us what it is</h3>
<p>I don't feel I'm qualified to teach people things but I wouldn't mind leading a fun, playful kind of workshop with painting/mixed media - however, this isn't related to the piece I'm asking for grant funds for so I'm not sure if that's what ya'll wanted in response to this question. But I love workshops! And support them! </p>
