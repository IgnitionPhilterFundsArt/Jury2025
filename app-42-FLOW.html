<p></p><h3>Description for the Jury: Explain the Project in Full. [This is the description that should explain why the jury should give you the funds so try to answer any questions they might have. Please include some language on how the Flipizens will interact with the piece.]</h3>
<p>This piece celebrates the natural beauty of Austin along with the weird. Austin green space comprises four major bodies of water: Lady Bird Lake, Lake Austin, Lake Travis, and Barton Creek. On the outside of the base pedestal is a wrap around continuous shimmer wall of the 4 connected bodies of water. The interior space will incorporate a dynamic color changing visual art mural showcasing the weirdness that is Austin’s hallmark, in addition to 2D art curated from local Austin mixed media artists.
On top of the base pedestal will be a kinetic moving dynamic swirling mass of the beloved Congress Street bats that have become synonymous with Austin. The colorful bats take flight powered by and emulating the joy of the burners riding the merry-go-round.
Iph note: More detailed drawings were linked to at a very extensive website but it showed who the members of the collective were so redacted
</p><h3>Will it need power?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>If it will need power, what is your power plan?</h3>
<p>all lights used for this installation are solar or battery powered, eliminating the need for a generator</p><h3>Does the piece incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is it climbable?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>If it does incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is climbable what is your safety plan?  [Note: if flame effects are used, your project will be subject to inspection by the Burnable Art Lead, who has final say if your project will burn during the event.]</h3>
<p>this installation does not incorporate flame effects and is not climbable, however it contains moving pieces activated by the nearby merry-go-round. all moving parts are at least 9' off the ground and outside people's reach.</p><h3>Does this piece already exist?</h3>
<p>Proposed Concept (Not Yet)</p><h3>What is your timeline detailing the planning, creation, installment, and leave no trace removal of your project?</h3>
<p>Design has been finalized and we are now working on details. The build will commence as soon as we receive funds for materials. All pieces will be pre-cut, sanded and painted as needed, pre-assembled in large sections, and checked to ensure they fit together during the pre-Flipside build. We expect to need 2-3 build days on the land before opening it to visitors. We expect to need 1.5 days to carefully disassemble and transport off the property. Project will bring moop-buckets and moop-sticks to be used for daily de-mooping, as well as for post event cleanup.</p><h3>Have you completed any other large scale art projects? Tell us about it/them: (In this media? Where and when? How did the project go? Did you learn any lessons from those projects we should know?)</h3>
<p>[Artist] is a long time resident artist of Austin who’s called the capital city his home for over a decade. In 2016, [Artist] brought Blue Box to Burning Man which was placed in inner playa and provided an interactive experience of entering a seemingly ordinary box which appeared bigger on the inside. Additionally, [Artist] has built effigies for regional burns including the Eiffel Tower at Freezerburn 2024. Aside from bringing his art to regional and the national burns, [Artist] is the founder and leads the 40 person camp [redacted] in Texas. *Iph note-Past photo 1 artist made the physical sign</p><h3>What is the amount you would like to receive? Please enter a dollar amount in this field.</h3>
<p>$1,000.00</p><h3>Budget</h3>
<p>app 42 budget.xlsx</p><h3>Alternative Budget-What is the minimum amount that you would need to bring a version of your project? Please provide an alternate dollar amount that will allow the expression of your vision and concept at a reduced scale. The Art Grant budget is limited and this will allow the jury an opportunity to consider funding a lower cost piece instead of passing on it altogether.</h3>
<p>$575</p><h3>Alternative Budget Description (if you would change the piece to match the new budget, please tell us how):</h3>
<p>Reduce the 3D texture on the greenbelt lake wall facades to a 2D flat painted surface; less detail and quantity on the swirling tornado of bats taking flight. Overall budget for this project is way more than $1000 and we are attempting to raise these funds privately. It has been a big undertaking and every dollar helps.</p><h3>Have you ever received an art grant in the past?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>Have you received funding from any other entity or regional for this piece previously? If so, who and how much and what are you changing? (Having received past funding will not disqualify you if you are using the funds to add to the piece.)</h3>
<p>n/a</p><h3>We may be having the next Ignition Philter fundraiser in Austin in fall of 2025 or spring of 2026. If the piece is still intact, would you be willing/ able to bring the piece to that event? [Or do you have another piece you would like to bring instead?]</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>In 2025-2026 We are hoping the some of the artists can give community workshops outside of Flipside at Lloyd, our Austin workshop. Do you think you have a workshop idea that could be provided to the community? If so, please tell us what it is</h3>
<p>Post event this art piece is heading for burning man 2025 as a part of Whirl of Art project and will be burned there. our team can organize a workshop in 2025 with a panel of artists who have successfully taken project to burning man in the past talking about the process, funding, project management, successes and pitfalls.

We intend to keep outer walls of the base pedestal and combine them with walls from other components to make another art piece that can be displayed at Ignition Philter fundraiser in the spring of 2026.</p><h3>Application Art</h3>
