        <h1>22 - The heart of </h1>

        <h3>Application Number</h3>
<p></p><h3>Description for the Jury: Explain the Project in Full. [This is the description that should explain why the jury should give you the funds so try to answer any questions they might have. Please include some language on how the Flipizens will interact with the piece.]</h3>
<p>The past few years, we've started decorating the inside of the WonderLounge tent. This year, we want to step it up a notch and create a light art piece. We will have a heart that beats to either a typical heartbeat, or we can change the beat to sync with the music. There will be "veins" and "arteries" that flow into/out of the heart, and the flow will be animated by pulses of light or the light changing colors. To make the heart more on theme with the burn, we will add paper mache texas flowers on the the veins/arteries/heart. This art piece will be yet another piece of eye candy for Flipizens to enjoy while hanging out at our camp.</p><h3>Will it need power?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>If it will need power, what is your power plan?</h3>
<p>Using the camp generator or a personal battery bank</p><h3>Does the piece incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is it climbable?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>If it does incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is climbable what is your safety plan?  [Note: if flame effects are used, your project will be subject to inspection by the Burnable Art Lead, who has final say if your project will burn during the event.]</h3>
<p>Definitely not using flames with paper mache :)  While the pole to the top of the [*****] tent is climbable, we will ask dancers to not touch the art. And the art will not move (at least not this year!)</p><h3>Does this piece already exist?</h3>
<p>Proposed Concept (Not Yet)</p><h3>What is your timeline detailing the planning, creation, installment, and leave no trace removal of your project?</h3>
<p>Week 1&2: Will cut out the heart structure from plywood and attach chicken wire to structure for 3D look. Week 3: Add paper mache to chicken wire and add white expandable vent hose for veins and arteries. Week 4: Paint paper mache heart Week 5-8: Make flowers for decorating. Week 9&10 will be extra time for unexpected issues. In tandem to the building of the physical heart, we will have a software programmer set up the lights for various sequences and speeds.</p><h3>Have you completed any other large scale art projects? Tell us about it/them: (In this media? Where and when? How did the project go? Did you learn any lessons from those projects we should know?)</h3>
<p>I have done decor for the [*****] tent for the past few years, and have done an art project of artifying old stuffed animals and adopting them out. From the projects I have done, I have learned to enlist others that want to help and always give yourself lots of time to create.</p><h3>What is the amount you would like to receive? Please enter a dollar amount in this field.</h3>
<p>$398.00</p><h3>Budget</h3>
<p>app 22-budget.xlsx</p><h3>Alternative Budget-What is the minimum amount that you would need to bring a version of your project? Please provide an alternate dollar amount that will allow the expression of your vision and concept at a reduced scale. The Art Grant budget is limited and this will allow the jury an opportunity to consider funding a lower cost piece instead of passing on it altogether.</h3>
<p>$220</p><h3>Alternative Budget Description (if you would change the piece to match the new budget, please tell us how):</h3>
<p>We would use old lights that we currently have, but the lights would not be programmable</p><h3>Have you ever received an art grant in the past?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>Have you received funding from any other entity or regional for this piece previously? If so, who and how much and what are you changing? (Having received past funding will not disqualify you if you are using the funds to add to the piece.)</h3>
<p>No, first time applying</p><h3>We may be having the next Ignition Philter fundraiser in Austin in fall of 2025 or spring of 2026. If the piece is still intact, would you be willing/ able to bring the piece to that event? [Or do you have another piece you would like to bring instead?]</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>In 2025-2026 We are hoping the some of the artists can give community workshops outside of Flipside at Lloyd, our Austin workshop. Do you think you have a workshop idea that could be provided to the community? If so, please tell us what it is</h3>
<p>Possibly, I know how to sew</p><h3>Application Art</h3>
