        <h3>Application Number</h3>
<p></p><h3>Description for the Jury: Explain the Project in Full. [This is the description that should explain why the jury should give you the funds so try to answer any questions they might have. Please include some language on how the Flipizens will interact with the piece.]</h3>
<p>This is going to be a slimmed down, revamped experiment to what I brought to Flipside 2023. I now have better power management and won't make it so gosh-darn big.

So the initial concept of the $PEEDY BEER EXPRE$$ is that everything at the burn is a gift, except this is a LOAN. I will have more signage up and a smaller storefront.

Part of the gift will be to accept and crush people's empties, and to supply a drop point for iced beer that subscribers in the know will be able to access more centrally located than their camps.

The game of $PEEDY BEER EXPRE$$ is to waste as much time as possible before giving out the beer. This can be done by intake questionnaire, psychological profiling, palm reading, reaction to various stimuli and recording reactions, so on. This is a hang-out project that will need a staff of at least two people to man the "storefront" and have a small hole for beer.

There are NO REPERCUSSIONS for not making good on loaned beer, only fake imagined consequences, but still may have people dropping off cases of beer like they did two years ago. I call it the Beeramid Scheme, and I'll make better signage and fun art that will get the point across.

It can work with just a little more training than the Bad Advice Booth, but it is a parody of the Customer Service Experience. Simple, easy, fun.

NOTE: I will be using scrap from the original to regurgitate an more artsy, decrepit, shambling sort of </p><h3>Will it need power?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>If it will need power, what is your power plan?</h3>
<p>It will run off the 500W Jackery that I already own</p><h3>Does the piece incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is it climbable?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>If it does incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is climbable what is your safety plan?  [Note: if flame effects are used, your project will be subject to inspection by the Burnable Art Lead, who has final say if your project will burn during the event.]</h3>
<p>** not provided **</p><h3>Does this piece already exist?</h3>
<p>Existing Artwork (it's done, just need help bringing it to Flipside)</p><h3>What is your timeline detailing the planning, creation, installment, and leave no trace removal of your project?</h3>
<p>Easier than two years ago! It will be way smaller and consist of a "front" store and nothing behind it - much like our corporate hellscape!</p><h3>Have you completed any other large scale art projects? Tell us about it/them: (In this media? Where and when? How did the project go? Did you learn any lessons from those projects we should know?)</h3>
<p>Yes, I have done this project before but it was TOO BIG. It was silly of me to think that way, but it was a learning experience and I want to show that by releasing a leaner, trimmer, more economical $PEEDY BEER EXPRE$$

I also have RETRO RESPITE, which will need no extra introduction and will  be registered as a companion piece elsewhere at the burn. That is a sit-down VHS project that is meant to act as a brief reprieve of weirdness for burners who aren't feeling terribly social.</p><h3>What is the amount you would like to receive? Please enter a dollar amount in this field.</h3>
<p>$300.00</p><h3>Budget</h3>
<p>app 38 budget-2.xlsx</p><h3>Alternative Budget-What is the minimum amount that you would need to bring a version of your project? Please provide an alternate dollar amount that will allow the expression of your vision and concept at a reduced scale. The Art Grant budget is limited and this will allow the jury an opportunity to consider funding a lower cost piece instead of passing on it altogether.</h3>
<p>$50</p><h3>Alternative Budget Description (if you would change the piece to match the new budget, please tell us how):</h3>
<p>I would make it horribly more decrepit and without paint</p><h3>Have you ever received an art grant in the past?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>Have you received funding from any other entity or regional for this piece previously? If so, who and how much and what are you changing? (Having received past funding will not disqualify you if you are using the funds to add to the piece.)</h3>
<p>I am using funds to add on to the piece from two years ago, when I was granted $575 and put $792 into it</p><h3>We may be having the next Ignition Philter fundraiser in Austin in fall of 2025 or spring of 2026. If the piece is still intact, would you be willing/ able to bring the piece to that event? [Or do you have another piece you would like to bring instead?]</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>In 2025-2026 We are hoping the some of the artists can give community workshops outside of Flipside at Lloyd, our Austin workshop. Do you think you have a workshop idea that could be provided to the community? If so, please tell us what it is</h3>
