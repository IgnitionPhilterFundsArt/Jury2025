            <h3>Description for the Jury: Explain the Project in Full. [This is the description that should explain why the jury should give you the funds so try to answer any questions they might have. Please include some language on how the Flipizens will interact with the piece.]</h3>
<p>Imagine you are hot and tired and the sun is beating down. You hear jingley jangley noises approaching, you look up and see a curious rickshaw bumbling towards you. “Cold Soup!” is called out over the crowd. People begin bumbling forward clutching at their bowls and spoons. What have they today? A cold borscht? An aromatic gazpacho? An unknown creation of dubious origin? Slake your thirst and your hunger and get some needed electrolytes from SOUPCART</p><h3>Application Art</h3>
<p><a href="./art/app-27-art-1.jpg" target="_blank" >app-27-art-1.jpg</a></p><h3>Will it need power?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>If it will need power, what is your power plan?</h3>
<p>** not provided **</p><h3>Does the piece incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is it climbable?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>If it does incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is climbable what is your safety plan?  [Note: if flame effects are used, your project will be subject to inspection by the Burnable Art Lead, who has final say if your project will burn during the event.]</h3>
<p>Not currently - but possibly!</p><h3>Does this piece already exist?</h3>
<p>In Progress (Making Changes)</p><h3>What is your timeline detailing the planning, creation, installment, and leave no trace removal of your project?</h3>
<p>The core of the cart is done (we built it initally for freezerburn to make cold things hot via propane powered turkey frier burner thing), but for flipside, we want to adapt it to make warm things cold instead. Swap out propane and burner for an icebath/cooler system, add racks for spices and other toppings, and make some other needed adjustments.</p><h3>Have you completed any other large scale art projects? Tell us about it/them: (In this media? Where and when? How did the project go? Did you learn any lessons from those projects we should know?)</h3>
<p>I'm more of a builder than an artist tbh. Have helped with daft, helped build that troll that's in pease park, built lots of chicken coops.</p><h3>Past Projects Art</h3>
<p><a href="./past/app-27-past-1.jpg" target="_blank" >app-27-past-1.jpg</a></p><h3>What is the amount you would like to receive? Please enter a dollar amount in this field.</h3>
<p>$150.00 </p><h3>Budget Spreadsheet</h3>
<p><a href="./budget/app-27-budget.png" target="_blank" >app-27-budget.png</a></p><h3>Alternative Budget-What is the minimum amount that you would need to bring a version of your project? Please provide an alternate dollar amount that will allow the expression of your vision and concept at a reduced scale. The Art Grant budget is limited and this will allow the jury an opportunity to consider funding a lower cost piece instead of passing on it altogether.</h3>
<p>75</p><h3>Alternative Budget Description (if you would change the piece to match the new budget, please tell us how):</h3>
<p>Drop the icebath and cold toppings aspects, just have essentially a portable 5/10gal cold drink beverage cart and just do cold broths instead of full soups</p><h3>Have you ever received an art grant in the past?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>Have you received funding from any other entity or regional for this piece previously? If so, who and how much and what are you changing? (Having received past funding will not disqualify you if you are using the funds to add to the piece.)</h3>
<p>no</p><h3>We may be having the next Ignition Philter fundraiser in Austin in fall of 2025 or spring of 2026. If the piece is still intact, would you be willing/ able to bring the piece to that event? [Or do you have another piece you would like to bring instead?]</h3>
<p>Maybe</p><h3>In 2025-2026 We are hoping the some of the artists can give community workshops outside of Flipside at Lloyd, our Austin workshop. Do you think you have a workshop idea that could be provided to the community? If so, please tell us what it is</h3>
<p>I will think on this</p>
