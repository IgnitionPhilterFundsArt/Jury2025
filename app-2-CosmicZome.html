            <h1>2 - Cosmic Zome</h1>
            <hr/>
            <h3>Description for the Jury: Explain the Project in Full. [This is the description that should explain why the jury should give you the funds so try to answer any questions they might have. Please include some language on how the Flipizens will interact with the piece.]</h3>
<p>The Cosmic Zome is a 13 foot tall, 20 foot diameter, projection-mapped zome that debuted at Flipside 2024.  Unlike traditional geodesic domes which are built out of triangles, a zome is a similar structure built from kite shapes instead of triangles.  This small twist creates a beautiful geometric shape suggesting sacred geometry, with the top of the zome forming the petals of a flower.  The wooden frame is covered with 84 panels, and multiple projectors inside the zome create a 360 degree continuous video wall for visitors to enjoy.  Visitors are invited to sit or lay down and look up at the roof of the structure to relax and get lost in the immersive video experience.

The version that was brought last year used cheap projector mounts which were unreliable and impacted the uptime of the project.  A new mounting system has been designed to resolve this issue so the art piece can be experienced by more people.

The funding request also includes money for projector rental.  If additional money can be raised (beyond Ignition Philter), the projection rental may be replaced with purchasing 3-4 projectors that are a better fit for the project's requirements (brighter and provide more coverage of the structure for a more immersive experience).</p><h3>Application Art</h3>

<p>Yes</p><h3>If it will need power, what is your power plan?</h3>
<p>Quiet Honda generator provided by the artist.</p><h3>Does the piece incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is it climbable?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>If it does incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is climbable what is your safety plan?  [Note: if flame effects are used, your project will be subject to inspection by the Burnable Art Lead, who has final say if your project will burn during the event.]</h3>
<p>** not provided **</p><h3>Does this piece already exist?</h3>
<p>In Progress (Making Changes)</p><h3>What is your timeline detailing the planning, creation, installment, and leave no trace removal of your project?</h3>
<p>The base project exists.  The new projector mounts will be fabricated by late February/early-March.
The project takes a team of 3 people approximately 8 hours to set up and will be done on Thursday at Flipside.
Teardown takes a team of 3 people approximately 3 hours and will be done Monday at Flipside.</p><h3>Have you completed any other large scale art projects? Tell us about it/them: (In this media? Where and when? How did the project go? Did you learn any lessons from those projects we should know?)</h3>
<p>Yes.  The original version of the Cosmic Zome was built and displayed at Flipside 2024.  This proposal seeks money to make upgrades to the existing project.  I have completed numerous other art projects in association with my camp, including projection mapping a box truck, two 8-foot tall LED towers, an 8 foot by 4 foot DJ booth facade, the 24-foot wide stage at our camp, and more.</p><h3>Past Projects Art</h3>
<p>** not provided **</p><h3>What is the amount you would like to receive? Please enter a dollar amount in this field.</h3>
<p>$745.45</p><h3>Budget Spreadsheet</h3>
<p><a href="./budget/app-2-budget.pdf" target="_blank" >app-2-budget.pdf</a></p><h3>Alternative Budget-What is the minimum amount that you would need to bring a version of your project? Please provide an alternate dollar amount that will allow the expression of your vision and concept at a reduced scale. The Art Grant budget is limited and this will allow the jury an opportunity to consider funding a lower cost piece instead of passing on it altogether.</h3>
<p>611.32</p><h3>Alternative Budget Description (if you would change the piece to match the new budget, please tell us how):</h3>
<p>The budget can be reduced by only renting projectors for a weekend instead of a month.  Currently, video content needs to be tested on the actual structure.  The monthly rental gives me time to make video content for the project ahead of time.  A weekly rental will limit the time available to make content since most of the weekend will be taken up by travel, setup, and teardown of the project.</p><h3>Have you ever received an art grant in the past?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>Have you received funding from any other entity or regional for this piece previously? If so, who and how much and what are you changing? (Having received past funding will not disqualify you if you are using the funds to add to the piece.)</h3>
<p>Yes, $575 from Ignition Philter in 2024 to build the base project.  This request is for replacing the projector mounts and rental of the projectors needed for the project.</p><h3>We may be having the next Ignition Philter fundraiser in Austin in fall of 2025 or spring of 2026. If the piece is still intact, would you be willing/ able to bring the piece to that event? [Or do you have another piece you would like to bring instead?]</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>In 2025-2026 We are hoping the some of the artists can give community workshops outside of Flipside at Lloyd, our Austin workshop. Do you think you have a workshop idea that could be provided to the community? If so, please tell us what it is</h3>
<p>I could talk about designing LED projects or projection mapping.</p>
