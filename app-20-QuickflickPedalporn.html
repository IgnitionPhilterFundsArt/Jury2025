            <h3>Description for the Jury: Explain the Project in Full. [This is the description that should explain why the jury should give you the funds so try to answer any questions they might have. Please include some language on how the Flipizens will interact with the piece.]</h3>
<p>It is a hand cranked pedal powered kinetoscope. The participant has to adjust the rotation  and the strobe light speeds at the same time to be able to watch the movie on the screen.

The art piece consists of a strobe light and a disassembled bicycle. The hand cranked chain rotates a wheel which holds the frames of the 3-4 second film on the rim. An adjustable strobe light projects the images of a unsavory porn on to a screen. If you get the rhythm perfect, it is non-stop fun.  </p><h3>Application Art</h3>
<p><a href="./art/app-20-art-1.png" target="_blank" >app-20-art-1.png</a></p><h3>Will it need power?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>If it will need power, what is your power plan?</h3>
<p>We have our own power</p><h3>Does the piece incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is it climbable?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>If it does incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is climbable what is your safety plan?  [Note: if flame effects are used, your project will be subject to inspection by the Burnable Art Lead, who has final say if your project will burn during the event.]</h3>
<p>It has a rotating bicycle wheel, bike chain, and a pedal. It is not mobile or climbable. It will not need extra safety</p><h3>Does this piece already exist?</h3>
<p>Proposed Concept (Not Yet)</p><h3>What is your timeline detailing the planning, creation, installment, and leave no trace removal of your project?</h3>
<p>Build: by April 15th. Move to Apache Acres with the camp. Installed and ready to go by Thursday night. Bring back after the burn.</p><h3>Have you completed any other large scale art projects? Tell us about it/them: (In this media? Where and when? How did the project go? Did you learn any lessons from those projects we should know?)</h3>
<p>Worked on effigies. Various other large scale art projects. We also provided small/medium art pieces through the years. Last year we did the Ferris Wheeler's Way Off art project (bicycle powered ferris wheel for stuffed animals)

This is not as fast as the ferris wheeler. We were unable to reduce the sizes of the pictures</p><h3>Past Projects Art</h3>

Please provide an alternate dollar amount that will allow the expression of your vision and concept at a reduced scale. The Art Grant budget is limited and this will allow the jury an opportunity to consider funding a lower cost piece instead of passing on it altogether.</h3>

<p>No</p><h3>Have you received funding from any other entity or regional for this piece previously? If so, who and how much and what are you changing? (Having received past funding will not disqualify you if you are using the funds to add to the piece.)</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>We may be having the next Ignition Philter fundraiser in Austin in fall of 2025 or spring of 2026. If the piece is still intact, would you be willing/ able to bring the piece to that event? [Or do you have another piece you would like to bring instead?]</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>In 2025-2026 We are hoping the some of the artists can give community workshops outside of Flipside at Lloyd, our Austin workshop. Do you think you have a workshop idea that could be provided to the community? If so, please tell us what it is</h3>
