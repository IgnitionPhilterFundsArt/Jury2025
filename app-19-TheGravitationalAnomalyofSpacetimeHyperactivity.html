        <h3>Description for the Jury: Explain the Project in Full. [This is the description that should explain why the jury should give you the funds so try to answer any questions they might have. Please include some language on how the Flipizens will interact with the piece.]</h3>
<p>“The Gravitational Anomaly of Spacetime Hyperactivity" is a tear in the fabric of reality—a portal to a mysterious dimension. From the outside, only the glowing, fractured entry is visible, framed by shimmering ruffles that pulse with vibrant light. The rest of the structure is concealed behind camo netting, blending into the surroundings and creating the illusion of a wound in spacetime. This cryptic design invites Flipizens to step through and uncover what lies beyond the rift, said to be responsible for much of the strangeness surrounding Flipside.
Inside, the anomaly reveals a surreal, womb-like environment filled with undulating tunnels and chambers. Black light hues, programmable RGB lighting, and an immersive soundscape create an otherworldly atmosphere, while a biomechanical laser cloudscape on the ceiling adds a mesmerizing touch. Flipizens are encouraged to explore, uncovering hidden details and piecing together its connection to the larger mystery of the “Liminal Lodge”. Whether experienced as an awe-inspiring work of art or a clue in a greater narrative, the anomaly offers moments of curiosity, discovery, and a shared sense of wonder.</p><h3>Application Art</h3>

<p>Yes</p><h3>If it will need power, what is your power plan?</h3>
<p>All electronics within the art piece will be powered by a portable 12 volt power station. Logistics have been made within our camp for battery maintenance.</p><h3>Does the piece incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is it climbable?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>If it does incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is climbable what is your safety plan?  [Note: if flame effects are used, your project will be subject to inspection by the Burnable Art Lead, who has final say if your project will burn during the event.]</h3>
<p>This piece does not have any flame effects or moveable pieces and will not be climbable.</p><h3>Does this piece already exist?</h3>
<p>In Progress (Making Changes)</p><h3>What is your timeline detailing the planning, creation, installment, and leave no trace removal of your project?</h3>
<p>January: PVC structure completed and enclosed
February: Interior decoration and painting completed
March: Lighting, electronic components, and secondary decorations/props finalized
April: Breakdown, packing, final touches, and logistical planning
April 23: Early entry setup; fully constructed before Flipside begins on April 24
April 28: Disassembly begins in the morning. All components packed and removed. Site fully cleared with no trace left, supervised by our Earth Guardian</p><h3>Have you completed any other large scale art projects? Tell us about it/them: (In this media? Where and when? How did the project go? Did you learn any lessons from those projects we should know?)</h3>
<p>Professional Architectural Designer
As an architectural designer, I thrive on envisioning and executing the big-picture plans that bring projects to life. My expertise lies in developing cohesive design strategies that balance creativity with functionality, ensuring every element aligns with the overarching vision. I excel at coordinating multidisciplinary teams, streamlining workflows, and integrating innovative solutions to achieve project goals. By maintaining a clear focus on the broader scope while addressing key details, I consistently deliver designs that are both impactful and practical.
Six Sci-Fi Art Installations at Flipside 2024
As a co-chair for our camp’s art installations for Flipside 2024, I collaborated on six sci-fi-themed art installations, each designed to immerse participants in narrative-rich, interactive experiences. These projects brought together creative storytelling and intricate visual design, captivating the audience at every turn. My role involved overseeing concept development, coordinating execution, and ensuring that all elements came together seamlessly. Each installation blended exploration with storytelling, offering participants unique, thought-provoking experiences that showcased our team’s ability to transform ambitious ideas into engaging realities.
AIA Sandcastles & AIA Gingerbread Competitions
My experience participating in architectural competitions such as Houston AIA’s Sandcastles and Gingerbread events has given me a deep appreciation for tackling unique design challenges. Leading these projects allowed me to work with unconventional materials while managing tight deadlines and coordinating teams effectively. The recognition I received in these competitions reflects my ability to combine detailed planning, creativity, and strong leadership to deliver exceptional results.

<p><a href="./past/app-19-past-2.png" target="_blank" >app-19-past-2.png</a></p><h3>What is the amount you would like to receive? Please enter a dollar amount in this field.</h3>
<p>$575.00</p><h3>Budget Spreadsheet</h3>
<p><a href="./budget/app-19-budget.png" target="_blank" >app-19-budget.png</a></p><h3>Alternative Budget-What is the minimum amount that you would need to bring a version of your project? Please provide an alternate dollar amount that will allow the expression of your vision and concept at a reduced scale. The Art Grant budget is limited and this will allow the jury an opportunity to consider funding a lower cost piece instead of passing on it altogether.</h3>
<p>$400</p><h3>Alternative Budget Description (if you would change the piece to match the new budget, please tell us how):</h3>
<p>A $400 budget will cover the basic structure and enclosure of the art piece. Additional funding beyond this amount would enable us to enhance the quality and detail of the artwork. Should we need to reduce the budget, we would focus on using simpler materials and more streamlined decoration methods to maintain the core vision while ensuring the piece is still impactful.</p><h3>Have you ever received an art grant in the past?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>Have you received funding from any other entity or regional for this piece previously? If so, who and how much and what are you changing? (Having received past funding will not disqualify you if you are using the funds to add to the piece.)</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>We may be having the next Ignition Philter fundraiser in Austin in fall of 2025 or spring of 2026. If the piece is still intact, would you be willing/ able to bring the piece to that event? [Or do you have another piece you would like to bring instead?]</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>In 2025-2026 We are hoping the some of the artists can give community workshops outside of Flipside at Lloyd, our Austin workshop. Do you think you have a workshop idea that could be provided to the community? If so, please tell us what it is</h3>
<p>We would be willing to figure out how we can teach our process of narrative storytelling through interactive are installations in a workshop. </p>
