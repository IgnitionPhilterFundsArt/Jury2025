            <h1>32 - Pieces of Joy</h1>
            <hr/>
            <h3>Description for the Jury: Explain the Project in Full. [This is the description that should explain why the jury should give you the funds so try to answer any questions they might have. Please include some language on how the Flipizens will interact with the piece.]</h3>
<p>Over the years of burns, I became sick of seeing cars just in camps with no sort of artifying. I decided I wanted to create art to gift (or loan if people don't want to keep it) to folks to use on their cars. The specific art is small quilted panels. These can be painter's taped to windshields or magneted to cars. The smaller pieces are great sizes to cover up adverts on portos to decommodify them to further spread the joy. They're interactive as folks look at how movement happens with the fabric (shape and color of pieces). Some fabrics are silly, some are colorful, some it's just how visual tricks can happen when shapes and fabrics are put back together.  It's also interactive for folks who come out to help create pre-event!

I would like to teach folks basic quilt piecing at Lloyd and have sewing meet-ups on build days (schedule TBD) so folks can contribute too. The cool thing about quilting is people of any abilities can help as there are many steps in the process: choosing fabrics; fabric cutting; fabric piecing (to make the patterns); sewing; and ironing. Fabrics to be used are ones I have on hand, upcycled fabrics, and donations.  As far as grant specific items, in order to improve the efficiency and quality of my work, and make it feasible to work with others at Lloyd, I need more tools to use. 

Small pieces have been to FZB; more are being made for Flipside.
</p><h3>Application Art</h3>
<p><a href="./art/app-32-art-1.jpg" target="_blank" >app-32-art-1.jpg</a></p><h3>Will it need power?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>If it will need power, what is your power plan?</h3>
<p>n/a</p><h3>Does the piece incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is it climbable?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>If it does incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is climbable what is your safety plan?  [Note: if flame effects are used, your project will be subject to inspection by the Burnable Art Lead, who has final say if your project will burn during the event.]</h3>
<p>n/a</p><h3>Does this piece already exist?</h3>
<p>In Progress (Making Changes)</p><h3>What is your timeline detailing the planning, creation, installment, and leave no trace removal of your project?</h3>
<p>Sewing will happen at home between now and the event and also at Lloyd during build/church (TBD based on office availability- target 4 days); regarding installment, I will painter's tape small pieces to decommodify the portos near HQ and KFLiP when I arrive and gift larger pieces for others for their cars along with magnets. Folks who join at Lloyd can make and take for themselves or to gift. For removal: either burn night or in the morning I will take down all porto pieces I place. If people do not want to keep what they used for their car, they can return it to my camp. </p><h3>Have you completed any other large scale art projects? Tell us about it/them: (In this media? Where and when? How did the project go? Did you learn any lessons from those projects we should know?)</h3>
<p>I made my first quilted piece for a panel at Sacred and Propane but I couldn't go due to Covid. The piece went with me to a couple of other burns to decorate my car. For this last FZB, I started making pieces to decorate cars and portos to help bring joy to simple places. None of the pieces are large. I had about 12 that fit into a Ziplock gallon bag :D</p><h3>Past Projects Art</h3>
<p><a href="./past/app-32-past-1.jpg" target="_blank" >app-32-past-1.jpg</a></p><h3>What is the amount you would like to receive? Please enter a dollar amount in this field.</h3>
<p>$160.64</p><h3>Budget Spreadsheet</h3>
<p><a href="./budget/app-32-budget.pdf" target="_blank" >app-32-budget.pdf</a></p><h3>Alternative Budget-What is the minimum amount that you would need to bring a version of your project? Please provide an alternate dollar amount that will allow the expression of your vision and concept at a reduced scale. The Art Grant budget is limited and this will allow the jury an opportunity to consider funding a lower cost piece instead of passing on it altogether.</h3>
<p>$100</p><h3>Alternative Budget Description (if you would change the piece to match the new budget, please tell us how):</h3>
<p>It would take longer to make pieces (either by myself or have others help) so there would be fewer pieces.</p><h3>Have you ever received an art grant in the past?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>Have you received funding from any other entity or regional for this piece previously? If so, who and how much and what are you changing? (Having received past funding will not disqualify you if you are using the funds to add to the piece.)</h3>
<p>I received $75 to buy my first round of quilting tools (rulers and blades- my sewing machine was still working) for FZB 2025. What I am changing is I am creating more pieces. </p><h3>We may be having the next Ignition Philter fundraiser in Austin in fall of 2025 or spring of 2026. If the piece is still intact, would you be willing/ able to bring the piece to that event? [Or do you have another piece you would like to bring instead?]</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>In 2025-2026 We are hoping the some of the artists can give community workshops outside of Flipside at Lloyd, our Austin workshop. Do you think you have a workshop idea that could be provided to the community? If so, please tell us what it is</h3>
<p>Absolutely! As part of my project I want to workshop before this Flipside with folks at Lloyd so they can learn how to manipulate simples shapes and colors to create fanciful artwork! They get to learn how to sew and properly cut fabric! (Ironing is important!) </p>
