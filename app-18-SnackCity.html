            <h3>Description for the Jury: Explain the Project in Full. [This is the description that should explain why the jury should give you the funds so try to answer any questions they might have. Please include some language on how the Flipizens will interact with the piece.]</h3>
<p>Snack City is a snack bar/tent open Thursday-Sunday 24 hours a day, The Graveyard/Halloween Town has brought out to Flipside every year since 2016. Imagine you're walking along with your buddies, you just got done dancing your heart out at one of the sound camps, and you're HUNGRY... don't want to walk all the way back to camp? Flipizens already know, The Graveyard/Halloween Town has snacks for this very moment. For when that midnight snack urge creeps in. And WE LOVE providing this for the community. However, we have seen our camp go from 30 people(biggest year) down to 12 last year... we still bring out the same amount of infrastructure and fun every year. And with dwindling camper numbers, yet our hearts still being all the way in this, we would like to ask for assistance with Snack City for the first time. So we can ensure our community stays fueled even into the wee hours of the morning.

One of the images below includes an including people from our camp that is being used with consent from them.  </p><h3>Application Art</h3>

<p>Yes</p><h3>If it will need power, what is your power plan?</h3>
<p>We bring a generator every year for our movies that powers the lights in the Snack City</p><h3>Does the piece incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is it climbable?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>If it does incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is climbable what is your safety plan?  [Note: if flame effects are used, your project will be subject to inspection by the Burnable Art Lead, who has final say if your project will burn during the event.]</h3>
<p>** not provided **</p><h3>Does this piece already exist?</h3>
<p>Existing Artwork (it's done, just need help bringing it to Flipside)</p><h3>What is your timeline detailing the planning, creation, installment, and leave no trace removal of your project?</h3>
<p>We have everything set up and open by 5pm on Thursday every single year we've done this. And have a trash can in the tent for people who do not MOOP their own MOOP. </p><h3>Have you completed any other large scale art projects? Tell us about it/them: (In this media? Where and when? How did the project go? Did you learn any lessons from those projects we should know?)</h3>
<p>I personally have a permanent installation in Seismique. An immersive art museum in Houston. I also put together a small Instagram photo corner as temporary Install in 2021 at winter street studios for Fresh Arts. Both were so much fun to put together and I learned a lot about planning and focused direction. I am also a fire manipulator and entertainer. I run my own performance collective in Houston: [*****]

Pictured is one of three Snails and Alien Prom which was the Instagram photo corner </p><h3>Past Projects Art</h3>
<p><a href="./past/app-18-past-1.jpeg" target="_blank" >app-18-past-1.jpeg</a></p><p><a href="./past/app-18-past-2.jpeg" target="_blank" >app-18-past-2.jpeg</a></p><h3>What is the amount you would like to receive? Please enter a dollar amount in this field.</h3>
<p>$575.00</p><h3>Budget Spreadsheet</h3>
<p><a href="./budget/app-18-budget.png" target="_blank" >app-18-budget.png</a></p><h3>Alternative Budget-What is the minimum amount that you would need to bring a version of your project? Please provide an alternate dollar amount that will allow the expression of your vision and concept at a reduced scale. The Art Grant budget is limited and this will allow the jury an opportunity to consider funding a lower cost piece instead of passing on it altogether.</h3>
<p>0</p><h3>Alternative Budget Description (if you would change the piece to match the new budget, please tell us how):</h3>
<p>$300/$400 would still help us out ; We will be bringing this out regardless of receiving funding. A part of our camp dues is everyone brings 4-5 family/value size snack boxes of something that's non meltable. </p><h3>Have you ever received an art grant in the past?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>Have you received funding from any other entity or regional for this piece previously? If so, who and how much and what are you changing? (Having received past funding will not disqualify you if you are using the funds to add to the piece.)</h3>
<p>Other than our camp dues, none</p><h3>We may be having the next Ignition Philter fundraiser in Austin in fall of 2025 or spring of 2026. If the piece is still intact, would you be willing/ able to bring the piece to that event? [Or do you have another piece you would like to bring instead?]</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>In 2025-2026 We are hoping the some of the artists can give community workshops outside of Flipside at Lloyd, our Austin workshop. Do you think you have a workshop idea that could be provided to the community? If so, please tell us what it is</h3>
