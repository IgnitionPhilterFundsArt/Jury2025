            <h3>Description for the Jury: Explain the Project in Full. [This is the description that should explain why the jury should give you the funds so try to answer any questions they might have. Please include some language on how the Flipizens will interact with the piece.]</h3>
<p>Rubatosis is a word created by John Koenig as part of his Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows. The entry for the word defines it as follows:

    “Rubatosis
n.
the unsettling awareness of your own heartbeat, whose tenuous muscular throbbing feels less like a metronome than a nervous ditty your heart is tapping to itself, as if to casually remind the outside world, I’m here, I’m here, I’m here.”

What makes us feel more alive than being at a burn? The art, the community, the atmosphere; The Pecan Playa is an intoxicating environment that invites our hearts to beat stronger and faster. 

"Rubatosis" seeks to amplify the heartbeat of participants in the form of fiery bursts that not only mimic their actual pulse, but embody their fiery passion for art. 
During the day participants will be encouraged to write about what stirs their hearts and ignites their passion, all over the 3.5ft X 5.4 ft metal canvas, painted to resemble the Texas flag.

The canvas will sit on a metal easel. The star on the flag will be elevated off the canvas surface, as will a shape of Texas. Further elevated off of the shape of Texas will be a heart. The heart will be covered with Kevlar to act as a wick. Fuel and salts applied to the Kevlar will cause it to burn continuously in multicolor flames when in operation

A control box will allow participants to place a finger on a pulse sensor. The sensor will dictate the speed of the two solenoid valves that actuate the flame effect, producing a flame in the same rhythm and speed as the participant’s pulse. Further buttons on the control box may be used to produce flames, lights or smoke.

<p><a href="./art/app-16-art-1.jpg" target="_blank" >app-16-art-1.jpg</a></p><p><a href="./art/app-16-art-2.jpg" target="_blank" >app-16-art-2.jpg</a></p><p><a href="./art/app-16-art-3.jpg" target="_blank" >app-16-art-3.jpg</a></p><h3>Will it need power?</h3>
<p>Maybe</p><h3>If it will need power, what is your power plan?</h3>
<p>Generator in Fire Garden</p><h3>Does the piece incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is it climbable?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>If it does incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is climbable what is your safety plan?  [Note: if flame effects are used, your project will be subject to inspection by the Burnable Art Lead, who has final say if your project will burn during the event.]</h3>
<p>The project will use ropes and signage to clearly designate a safety buffer zone around the flame effect. A fire extinguisher will be on hand. The effect will only be in operation while qualified individuals are present  to direct or oversee interactions with the project. There will be standard killswitches and shutoffs. All fuel will be kept at a safe distance from the flame. </p><h3>Does this piece already exist?</h3>
<p>Proposed Concept (Not Yet)</p><h3>What is your timeline detailing the planning, creation, installment, and leave no trace removal of your project?</h3>
<p>February 1-15: assemble basic structures and components
February 15-28: combine elements and wire/program controls
March: testing and decorating
Early entry: erect project in Fire Garden
Last day of event: disassemble project early to allow time for packing out and checking for moop. 
</p><h3>Have you completed any other large scale art projects? Tell us about it/them: (In this media? Where and when? How did the project go? Did you learn any lessons from those projects we should know?)</h3>
<p>I created a large-scale fire effect for Flipside 2025 called "Ring in the Year of the Dragon." The piece was 20ft tall, incorporated LED animations, sound effects, an interactive game and prizes. 

Making that piece taught me many new skills and valuable lessons. I collaborated on coding, learned to weld, pushed my electronics know how to it's limits, and engaged in glorious battle on the playa with Murphy's Law. 

At other burns I have created several large art pieces and characters to interact with them. I have run a full-scale apothocary with over 60 potion bottles and elaborate decor, where we mixed drinks and told fortunes. I have used a gas powered sniper rifle to launch marshmellows for burners to catch. I have made large elaborate signs for our camp. </p><h3>Past Projects Art</h3>

Please enter a dollar amount in this field.</h3>
<p>$350.00</p><h3>Budget Spreadsheet</h3>
<p><a href="./budget/app-16-budget.png" target="_blank" >app-16-budget.png</a></p><h3>Alternative Budget-What is the minimum amount that you would need to bring a version of your project? Please provide an alternate dollar amount that will allow the expression of your vision and concept at a reduced scale. The Art Grant budget is limited and this will allow the jury an opportunity to consider funding a lower cost piece instead of passing on it altogether.</h3>
<p>$200</p><h3>Alternative Budget Description (if you would change the piece to match the new budget, please tell us how):</h3>
<p>The piece may be smaller and have less interactive components. It would probably only have a single valve, no wick/colorful heart or other lights/effects. It would still replicate heartrate. </p><h3>Have you ever received an art grant in the past?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>Have you received funding from any other entity or regional for this piece previously? If so, who and how much and what are you changing? (Having received past funding will not disqualify you if you are using the funds to add to the piece.)</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>We may be having the next Ignition Philter fundraiser in Austin in fall of 2025 or spring of 2026. If the piece is still intact, would you be willing/ able to bring the piece to that event? [Or do you have another piece you would like to bring instead?]</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>In 2025-2026 We are hoping the some of the artists can give community workshops outside of Flipside at Lloyd, our Austin workshop. Do you think you have a workshop idea that could be provided to the community? If so, please tell us what it is</h3>
<p>Yes! I would like to do a series of workshops about how to craft with different types of foam.</p>
