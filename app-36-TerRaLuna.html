            <h3>Description for the Jury: Explain the Project in Full. [This is the description that should explain why the jury should give you the funds so try to answer any questions they might have. Please include some language on how the Flipizens will interact with the piece.]</h3>
<p>TerRa Luna is being crafted by a dedicated team from Houston. Inspired by the city's profound ties to space exploration, this ambitious art project seeks to celebrate Houston's historical significance in humanity's ventures beyond our planet.  
At its core, TerRa Luna is a 10-foot tall kinetic, flowering seed sculpture that sits upon a 9-foot tall wooden base and opens as the merry-go-round takes participants for a ride. When the kinetic seed is in its closed state, the focal point is the wind-powered spinning sphere positioned above the seed. The gleaming sphere represents both the sun and moon, with its radiant presence shifting depending on the viewer's perspective. As the seed opens, it reveals an enchanting transformation – the Terran globe at its core is an intricate representation of earth as the Eye of the World blooming in a magnificent fountain of creation, reaching towards the celestial sun and moon, symbolizing the creative forces that flow from our planet to the vast cosmic expanse. This dynamic interplay of elements within the art piece invites us to explore the interwoven relationship between earth, space, and the human spirit.
The wooden pedestal base, aside from being the anchor for the sculpture, serves as a specially curated art gallery inside. The communal art piece "Chandelier of Dreams" serves as a canvas for community members to inscribe their personal visions for the future on acrylic pieces, projecting a collective desire to manifest change and enabling many to share their dreams with participants on the playa. These are surrounded by a collection of 2D art pieces showcasing the work of a variety of local Houston artists. The space is designed with a celestial theme, with galaxies and stars projected onto the floor, creating an immersive and otherworldly atmosphere that encourages visitors to gaze around and ponder the mysteries of the great cosmos. Visual art is supplemented by a carefully selected musical compilation playing in the background. 
Outside of the base serves as a canvas for numerous artists to express what Houston means to them: the enormous rural city with a small urban center crisscrossed by the widest freeways in the country, a port and the energy capital, one of the most ethnically and racially diverse cities, and our home of resilience in the face of natural disasters.
 TerRa Luna, as a whole, celebrates community by weaving together the threads of big city life, nature, culture, and the cosmos, encouraging viewers to contemplate their own dreams, the collective wisdom of humanity, and the boundless potential of creative expression in the unspoken language of art.
</p><h3>Application Art</h3>
<p><a href="./art/app-36-art-1.jpg" target="_blank" >app-36-art-1.jpg</a></p><p><a href="./art/app-36-art-2.jpg" target="_blank" >app-36-art-2.jpg</a></p><h3>Will it need power?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>If it will need power, what is your power plan?</h3>
<p>All lights used for this installation are solar or battery powered, eliminating the need for a generator. </p><h3>Does the piece incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is it climbable?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>If it does incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is climbable what is your safety plan?  [Note: if flame effects are used, your project will be subject to inspection by the Burnable Art Lead, who has final say if your project will burn during the event.]</h3>
<p>This installation does not incorporate flame effects and is not climbable, however it contains moving pieces activated by the nearby merry-go-round. All moving parts are at least 9’ off the ground and outside people’s reach.
</p><h3>Does this piece already exist?</h3>
<p>In Progress (Making Changes)</p><h3>What is your timeline detailing the planning, creation, installment, and leave no trace removal of your project?</h3>
<p>Repairs and upgrades to TerRa Luna will be completed between now and 2 weeks before Flipside.</p><h3>Have you completed any other large scale art projects? Tell us about it/them: (In this media? Where and when? How did the project go? Did you learn any lessons from those projects we should know?)</h3>
<p>Project lead has been a builder for multiple art projects at Flipside ("Mermicorn Tower", "TETRA") and Burning Man ("TETRA" , "Momentomorium”). TerRa Luna already made its first successful appearance at Freezerburn 2024, Flipside 2024 and Apogaea 2024. One of his co-leads helped build an art project, while the other was a builder and contributing artist for an art project at Burning Man 2023 and took Whirl to Burning Man 2024 as a build lead.
</p><h3>Past Projects Art</h3>
<p>** not provided **</p><h3>What is the amount you would like to receive? Please enter a dollar amount in this field.</h3>
<p>$575.00</p><h3>Budget Spreadsheet</h3>
<p><a href="./budget/app-36-budget.pdf" target="_blank" >app-36-budget.pdf</a></p><h3>Alternative Budget-What is the minimum amount that you would need to bring a version of your project? Please provide an alternate dollar amount that will allow the expression of your vision and concept at a reduced scale. The Art Grant budget is limited and this will allow the jury an opportunity to consider funding a lower cost piece instead of passing on it altogether.</h3>
<p>400</p><h3>Alternative Budget Description (if you would change the piece to match the new budget, please tell us how):</h3>
<p>Overall budget for this project is way more than $1000 and we are attempting to raise these funds privately. It has been a big undertaking and every dollar helps</p><h3>Have you ever received an art grant in the past?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>Have you received funding from any other entity or regional for this piece previously? If so, who and how much and what are you changing? (Having received past funding will not disqualify you if you are using the funds to add to the piece.)</h3>
<p>We received funding from FreezerBurn, Ignition Philter, Apogaea, but it covered only a small portion of the actual costs. Please see the spreadsheet for cost breakdown.</p><h3>We may be having the next Ignition Philter fundraiser in Austin in fall of 2025 or spring of 2026. If the piece is still intact, would you be willing/ able to bring the piece to that event? [Or do you have another piece you would like to bring instead?]</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>In 2025-2026 We are hoping the some of the artists can give community workshops outside of Flipside at Lloyd, our Austin workshop. Do you think you have a workshop idea that could be provided to the community? If so, please tell us what it is</h3>
<p>Yes, welding and construction classes</p>
