        <h3>Application Number</h3>
<p></p><h3>Description for the Jury: Explain the Project in Full. [This is the description that should explain why the jury should give you the funds so try to answer any questions they might have. Please include some language on how the Flipizens will interact with the piece.]</h3>
<p>This project is a projection mapped shade sail comfy space for burners to lie down, zone out, and enjoy the visuals mapped onto all of the shade sails through a single fisheye lens connected to an 7k lumen HD laser projector in the middle of the space.  The projection will be visible from inside and outside of the dome like structure.  Some sort of meditative audio track will be playing and the visuals will react to it.  The projection system will only be active during the nighttime, however the meditative soundtrack will play 24/7 and be a nice shaded space to hang out during the day time.</p><h3>Will it need power?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>If it will need power, what is your power plan?</h3>
<p>1 Wen 4800W inverter quiet generator with aux fuel tank</p><h3>Does the piece incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is it climbable?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>If it does incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is climbable what is your safety plan?  [Note: if flame effects are used, your project will be subject to inspection by the Burnable Art Lead, who has final say if your project will burn during the event.]</h3>
<p>** not provided **</p><h3>Does this piece already exist?</h3>
<p>Proposed Concept (Not Yet)</p><h3>What is your timeline detailing the planning, creation, installment, and leave no trace removal of your project?</h3>
<p>february (planning and gathering materials), March(build and testing), April (scramble, polish), april 23rd arrive at flipside and start setting up, april 24th operational, april 29th strike and de-moop.</p><h3>Have you completed any other large scale art projects? Tell us about it/them: (In this media? Where and when? How did the project go? Did you learn any lessons from those projects we should know?)</h3>
<p>I was on the build team for Walker Babington's Burden of the Beast, and Zozobot at the big burn and engulf.  I was the lead artist for The Cream Dream which was featured as the 9 o'clock keyhole installation for the big burn '24.  I also received an engulf art grant to setup The Cream Dream for Engulf '24.  Lots of lessons learned every time.  Thankfully this project is a bit smaller than the rest of them, and I have already developed the fisheye projection systems from my work on The Cream Dream.</p><h3>What is the amount you would like to receive? Please enter a dollar amount in this field.</h3>
<p>$1,000.00</p><h3>Budget</h3>
<p>app 33-budget.csv</p><h3>Alternative Budget-What is the minimum amount that you would need to bring a version of your project? Please provide an alternate dollar amount that will allow the expression of your vision and concept at a reduced scale. The Art Grant budget is limited and this will allow the jury an opportunity to consider funding a lower cost piece instead of passing on it altogether.</h3>
<p>500</p><h3>Alternative Budget Description (if you would change the piece to match the new budget, please tell us how):</h3>
<p>much smaller shade area with a simpler design for the structure</p><h3>Have you ever received an art grant in the past?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>Have you received funding from any other entity or regional for this piece previously? If so, who and how much and what are you changing? (Having received past funding will not disqualify you if you are using the funds to add to the piece.)</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>We may be having the next Ignition Philter fundraiser in Austin in fall of 2025 or spring of 2026. If the piece is still intact, would you be willing/ able to bring the piece to that event? [Or do you have another piece you would like to bring instead?]</h3>
<p>Maybe</p><h3>In 2025-2026 We are hoping the some of the artists can give community workshops outside of Flipside at Lloyd, our Austin workshop. Do you think you have a workshop idea that could be provided to the community? If so, please tell us what it is</h3>
<p>I could do a workshop on projection mapping and abnormal projector usage.  I live in NOLA though, so it would be a bit of a trip for me to make it out.</p><h3>Application Art</h3>
