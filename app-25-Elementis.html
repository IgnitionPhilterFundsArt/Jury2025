        <h3>Description for the Jury: Explain the Project in Full. [This is the description that should explain why the jury should give you the funds so try to answer any questions they might have. Please include some language on how the Flipizens will interact with the piece.]</h3>
<p>Elementis: 

Elementis is an art project that brings the ancient symbols of the classical elements—Air, Fire, Water, Earth, and Spirit (Ether)—into a modern, tangible form. Comprising five aluminum sculptures, each piece represents one of these elements, not just through their ancient symbol representations, but by physically embodying the elements themselves within the negative spaces of the sculptures.

Crafted from aluminum, a material chosen for its reflective qualities, its lightweight, and durability, each sculpture features a precisely cut geometric symbol. These symbols are:

1. Air - Upward Triangle with a Line Through It
2. Fire - Upward Triangle
3. Water - Downward Triangle
4. Earth - Downward Triangle with a Line Through It
5. Spirit (Ether - Circle with a Wheel Design

The unique aspect of this project lies in how each element is physically integrated into the artwork. The negative spaces within the aluminum structures are not empty voids but are instead integrate the actual elements they represent. This transforms the sculptures from static representations into living, dynamic pieces that interact with their environment and the viewer.

- Air: The Air symbol captures the invisible essence of air by allowing natural airflow through its structure. The negative space is designed to channel and reveal the movement of air, revealed by a single feather that flutters in the breeze, making the element's presence felt in a subtle yet powerful way.

- Fire: The Fire symbol houses a real flame within its negative space. This propane flame brings the element of fire to life, radiating warmth and energy. The flame not only represents fire’s transformative power but also creates a captivating visual interplay with the aluminum.

- Water: The Water symbol features a flowing water element; A dripping fountain will be integrated into its negative space. This element brings the symbol’s fluidity to life, with the water's movement and reflection echoing the changing, reflective nature of this element.

- Earth: The Earth symbol is grounded by containing in its negative space a large crystal. This inclusion emphasizes the solidity and nurturing qualities of earth, making the symbol not just a representation but a physical manifestation of stability and grounding.

- Spirit (Ether): The Spirit symbol, representing the unifying element, incorporates light and fog into its negative space, symbolizing the ethereal and all-encompassing nature of Spirit as it flows outward and interacts with the other elements.

The sculptures are arranged in a circular formation or a large upright star shape, symbolizing the interconnectedness and balance of the elements. The central or top piece, representing Spirit (Ether), serves as the anchor, with the other four elements positioned around it and with it. This arrangement invites viewers to engage with each element individually while also experiencing the harmony and interaction between them.

The Elementis project offers a multisensory experience, blending the visual impact of aluminum with the tangible presence of the elements themselves. It invites contemplation on the forces that shape both the natural world and our inner lives, bridging ancient symbolism with contemporary art to create an immersive, dynamic installation. This project not only makes the abstract concepts of the elements accessible but also allows viewers to connect with them in a direct and meaningful way, transforming the unseen forces of nature into a living, breathing experience.

<p>Yes</p><h3>If it will need power, what is your power plan?</h3>
<p>Artist / camp provided</p><h3>Does the piece incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is it climbable?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>If it does incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is climbable what is your safety plan?  [Note: if flame effects are used, your project will be subject to inspection by the Burnable Art Lead, who has final say if your project will burn during the event.]</h3>
<p>I might do projection mapping instead of the effects in each elemental symbol. But if not it  project would include a flame effect in a torch system. The project would fenced and the fuel tank will be in a locked cage to deny access to the flame and the gas feeding it.
I also would hope to have it placed right next to my tent on the edge of the yayborhood providing constant camp member eyes on it.</p><h3>Does this piece already exist?</h3>
<p>Existing Artwork (it's done, just need help bringing it to Flipside)</p><h3>What is your timeline detailing the planning, creation, installment, and leave no trace removal of your project?</h3>
<p>If I do projection mapping this might change.

The project is created. I need to replace some parts, fix any issues, paint the base. etc..
The project is modular and leaves no trace except for possible water on the ground. </p><h3>Have you completed any other large scale art projects? Tell us about it/them: (In this media? Where and when? How did the project go? Did you learn any lessons from those projects we should know?)</h3>
<p>Yes. 
Octahedra: Burning man 13-16, Flipside: Before (lol cant remember the years and how many</p><h3>Past Projects Art</h3>
<p><a href="./past/app-25-past-1.jpg" target="_blank" >app-25-past-1.jpg</a></p><p><a href="./past/app-25-past-2.jpg" target="_blank" >app-25-past-2.jpg</a></p><h3>What is the amount you would like to receive? Please enter a dollar amount in this field.</h3>
<p>$500.00</p><h3>Budget Spreadsheet</h3>
<p><a href="./budget/app-25-budget.pdf" target="_blank" >app-25-budget.pdf</a></p><h3>Alternative Budget-What is the minimum amount that you would need to bring a version of your project? Please provide an alternate dollar amount that will allow the expression of your vision and concept at a reduced scale. The Art Grant budget is limited and this will allow the jury an opportunity to consider funding a lower cost piece instead of passing on it altogether.</h3>
<p>$200.00</p><h3>Alternative Budget Description (if you would change the piece to match the new budget, please tell us how):</h3>
<p>I would bring it out as is but would still hope for help with transportation cost, propane, and a pump for the water feature.</p><h3>Have you ever received an art grant in the past?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>Have you received funding from any other entity or regional for this piece previously? If so, who and how much and what are you changing? (Having received past funding will not disqualify you if you are using the funds to add to the piece.)</h3>
<p>Yes, for it's construction and supplies at Engulf 2024.</p><h3>We may be having the next Ignition Philter fundraiser in Austin in fall of 2025 or spring of 2026. If the piece is still intact, would you be willing/ able to bring the piece to that event? [Or do you have another piece you would like to bring instead?]</h3>
<p>Maybe</p><h3>In 2025-2026 We are hoping the some of the artists can give community workshops outside of Flipside at Lloyd, our Austin workshop. Do you think you have a workshop idea that could be provided to the community? If so, please tell us what it is</h3>
<p>Id like to and I have some ideas but am unable to commit to a concrete answer now.</p>
