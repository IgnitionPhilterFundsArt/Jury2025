            <h3>Description for the Jury: Explain the Project in Full. [This is the description that should explain why the jury should give you the funds so try to answer any questions they might have. Please include some language on how the Flipizens will interact with the piece.]</h3>
<p>"Failure" is a large-scale sculptural project constructed entirely
from discarded materials sourced through dumpster diving (and other
forms of waste/ “trash” collection), second hand stores, and the
repurposing of my own "failed" art projects. Accompanied by a looping
silent, short film projected onto a screen within the sculpture. This
short film will contain footage of the creation process, open source
footage of environmentally devastated areas, and theme-relevant poetry
and other short form writings placed over portions of the video. This
work explores themes such as waste, consumption, and the inherent
beauty found in the discarded and overlooked.
Our culture generates an overwhelming amount of waste. "Failure"
confronts this reality head-on by transforming discarded objects—items
deemed no longer “useful or desirable”—into a compelling artistic
statement. By giving these materials a new life, the sculpture
challenges conventional notions of value and prompts viewers to
reconsider their relationship with consumption and disposability.
Hopefully, inspiring attempts to discover the beauty or another
purpose for our belongings, before discarding them. Exploring the
hidden narratives embedded within discarded objects and using art to
raise awareness about environmental issues. "Failure" represents a
culmination of these interests, offering a powerful visual statement
about the consequences of our consumerist culture and the potential
for transformation and rebirth.
The project incorporates a variety of materials, ranging from
discarded plastics and metals to textiles, wood scraps, and components
of unfinished or abandoned artwork. These diverse elements will be
combined and reconfigured through processes of assemblage, welding,
fastening, and layering with any newfound skill I acquire to create
this sculpture. If any sound elements would be incorporated, I
envision a white noise machine would be the extent. I am a mixed media
artist by trade, so learning new mediums and tooling methods is very
familiar to my practice. The resulting sculpture will be a complex and
dynamic composition including at least several sections of figure-like
representations and mask-presenting faces constructed with and adorned
with the other found items. Reflecting the chaotic, yet strangely
beautiful nature of waste itself enveloping us as we have become
unwillingly built into the existing systems of waste. I aim to build
an environment around the figure-like sculpture(s), that conveys that
the beings within this sculpture are made of the same stuff as all the
world around them. Flipizens will be able to walk through the
environment.
A key element of "Failure" is the inclusion of my own "failed" art
projects. These pieces, which did not achieve their initial intended
purpose, are not considered failures within my practice. Instead, they
represent an essential stage in my creative process, an accelerated
launching point aimed towards new possibilities and a reinvigorated,
revised purpose (maybe even a bit closer to the fullest sense of its
purpose, that could only come to fruition after a re-orienting
failure). By integrating these pieces into the larger sculpture, I aim
to highlight the inherent value of experimentation and the potential
for beauty to emerge from unexpected sources. This process of
re-evaluation and repurposing mirrors the project’s overall message
about the cyclical nature of creation and destruction and the beauty
of it ALL. Due to the nature of the project, I do not have direct
depictions of what the outcome will be, but have attached referenced
inspirational artists and other sketched options that I aim for,
waste-willing.
Another intention of this piece is to continue building upon and
morphing the works as time progresses. I anticipate a continuous build
and morph to expand upon and refine the strong messages associated
with the piece. A “living” sculpture that adapts to the social and
environmental concerns of the time spent in creation.

<p>Proposed Concept (Not Yet)</p><h3>What is your timeline detailing the planning, creation, installment, and leave no trace removal of your project?</h3>
<p>2/1 - 3/1-25: Collection and construction
3/1 - 4/1/25: environmental construction and finalization
2/1/25 - 4/15/25: collecting footage, writing poetry, and finalizing “rough cut” of short film

<p>Mixed media artist with several gallery exhibition shows participated in, some co-hosted! My latest large scale project was hosting a winter solstice celebration in which I learned many project management lessons. </p><h3>Past Projects Art</h3>

Please provide an alternate dollar amount that will allow the expression of your vision and concept at a reduced scale. The Art Grant budget is limited and this will allow the jury an opportunity to consider funding a lower cost piece instead of passing on it altogether.</h3>
<p>475</p><h3>Alternative Budget Description (if you would change the piece to match the new budget, please tell us how):</h3>
<p>Less money on secondhand finds, more time curating from trash/full waste ideas. </p><h3>Have you ever received an art grant in the past?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>Have you received funding from any other entity or regional for this piece previously? If so, who and how much and what are you changing? (Having received past funding will not disqualify you if you are using the funds to add to the piece.)</h3>
<p>No.</p><h3>We may be having the next Ignition Philter fundraiser in Austin in fall of 2025 or spring of 2026. If the piece is still intact, would you be willing/ able to bring the piece to that event? [Or do you have another piece you would like to bring instead?]</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>In 2025-2026 We are hoping the some of the artists can give community workshops outside of Flipside at Lloyd, our Austin workshop. Do you think you have a workshop idea that could be provided to the community? If so, please tell us what it is</h3>
