            <h3>Description for the Jury: Explain the Project in Full. [This is the description that should explain why the jury should give you the funds so try to answer any questions they might have. Please include some language on how the Flipizens will interact with the piece.]</h3>
<p>My other half and I have brought Dhaba Tacos to Flipside since 2018. It has grown each year and turned into an interactive food experience. Food is a vital part of every person's life but so many people are disconnected from their food and the people who prepare it. At the Dhaba we  strive to connect people to each other and their food through a shared culinary experience. In the past we taught people how to make naan and some of the cultural history behind the food that goes with the naan. This year we will keep the crowd favorite of naan but instead of buying store bought chicken and preparing the food ahead of time we want to have a cooking demonstration using wild hog harvested from our neighborhood. 
So many people won’t eat wild meat because they think it doesn’t taste good. At the Dhaba we want to share the art of cooking wild game. There is a stigma against eating wild hog for many reasons. In the cooking demonstration we want to dispel some of the myths and share food stories about why we harvest wild hogs.
The line for Dhaba Tacos can be intimidating so anyone who attends the Hog Wild will receive a line jumper ticket. This is a way we can encourage a different group of participants to interact with our art. We strive to create opportunities for those wishing to engage in art but are not planners or don’t have the ability to bring art themselves. Having our food art be broken into two parts increases the opportunities for others to participate. 
 This year we have a goal of feeding 80 to 100 people. We will have vegan and gluten free options too.

<p>No</p><h3>If it will need power, what is your power plan?</h3>
<p>** not provided **</p><h3>Does the piece incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is it climbable?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>If it does incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is climbable what is your safety plan?  [Note: if flame effects are used, your project will be subject to inspection by the Burnable Art Lead, who has final say if your project will burn during the event.]</h3>
<p>** not provided **</p><h3>Does this piece already exist?</h3>
<p>In Progress (Making Changes)</p><h3>What is your timeline detailing the planning, creation, installment, and leave no trace removal of your project?</h3>
<p>The recipe and process is well tested and I feel confident that I can bring it to Flipside without any problems. I need to photograph the next wild hog hunt and animal processing as well as formalize the recipe for the class. It will take about half a days work to prepare and everything else will be done on site.</p><h3>Have you completed any other large scale art projects? Tell us about it/them: (In this media? Where and when? How did the project go? Did you learn any lessons from those projects we should know?)</h3>
<p>Yes I have done something like this before at Freezer Burn and large camp outs. I have learned a lot about how to  streamlined the process to reduce stress and be on time rather than on burner time. 
I have found that people are cautious about trying wild hog but the delicious smell and the positive feedback from other participants usually gets people to try it.</p><h3>Past Projects Art</h3>
<p><a href="./past/app-28-past-1.jpg" target="_blank" >app-28-past-1.jpg</a></p><p><a href="./past/app-28-past-2.jpg" target="_blank" >app-28-past-2.jpg</a></p><p><a href="./past/app-28-past-3.jpg" target="_blank" >app-28-past-3.jpg</a></p><h3>What is the amount you would like to receive? Please enter a dollar amount in this field.</h3>
<p>$100.00</p><h3>Budget Spreadsheet</h3>
<p><a href="./budget/app-28-budget.pdf" target="_blank" >app-28-budget.pdf</a></p><h3>Alternative Budget-What is the minimum amount that you would need to bring a version of your project? Please provide an alternate dollar amount that will allow the expression of your vision and concept at a reduced scale. The Art Grant budget is limited and this will allow the jury an opportunity to consider funding a lower cost piece instead of passing on it altogether.</h3>
<p>$50</p><h3>Alternative Budget Description (if you would change the piece to match the new budget, please tell us how):</h3>
<p>With a smaller budget I could still bring this piece but I would serve less people, 50 to 70.</p><h3>Have you ever received an art grant in the past?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>Have you received funding from any other entity or regional for this piece previously? If so, who and how much and what are you changing? (Having received past funding will not disqualify you if you are using the funds to add to the piece.)</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>We may be having the next Ignition Philter fundraiser in Austin in fall of 2025 or spring of 2026. If the piece is still intact, would you be willing/ able to bring the piece to that event? [Or do you have another piece you would like to bring instead?]</h3>
<p>Maybe</p><h3>In 2025-2026 We are hoping the some of the artists can give community workshops outside of Flipside at Lloyd, our Austin workshop. Do you think you have a workshop idea that could be provided to the community? If so, please tell us what it is</h3>
<p>No</p>
