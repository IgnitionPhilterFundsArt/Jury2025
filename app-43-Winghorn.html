        <h3>Description for the Jury: Explain the Project in Full. [This is the description that should explain why the jury should give you the funds so try to answer any questions they might have. Please include some language on how the Flipizens will interact with the piece.]</h3>
<p>The art piece, titled 'Winghorn,' is a tribute to Pegasus, the unofficial mascot of Dallas, Texas, and the Longhorn bull, the official mascot of Fort Worth, Texas. Standing as a symbol of the home for North Texas burners, the art piece takes the form of a Pegasus with the head of a Longhorn. Crafted with meticulous attention to detail, each wing features intricate designs of bluebonnets carved into the wood. The wooden surface of the sculpture is charred and tinted purple. The bull's eyes are a prominent focal point, made from iridescent glass lit from the inside, creating an almost otherworldly glow that makes the creature appear as if it’s watching over the playa.
Similar to other art installations in the Whirl of Art, 'Winghorn' is connected to the merry-go-round and offers an interactive and kinetic experience. When burners hop on the merry-go-round and begin their whimsical ride, the creature lowers and raises its head, exhaling puffs of smoke with every turn.
At night, the body of the animal and the wings is outlined in LED lights. The eyes of the bull glow purple, while red lights highlight the smoke coming out of its nose. Multiple spotlights up-light the sculpture in purple from the corners of the pedestal.
The inside of the base is transformed into a colorful art gallery with modern wall designs and futuristic light fixtures, referencing the growth of the cities as art and technological centers. The gallery features individual contributions from a diverse group of Dallas/Fort Worth artists focusing on animal and plans that are part of our environment.
The exterior of the base is adorned with intricate murals depicting landscapes, plants, and animals—a living tapestry of nature representing this part of Texas, illuminated with downlight LED strips at night. 'Winghorn' serves as a reminder that, although burns unite people in a collective celebration of self-expression, we should not lose the sense of wonder that comes from connecting with the nature around us.
</p><h3>Application Art</h3>
<p><a href="./art/app-43-art-1.jpeg" target="_blank" >app-43-art-1.jpeg</a></p><p><a href="./art/app-43-art-2.jpeg" target="_blank" >app-43-art-2.jpeg</a></p><h3>Will it need power?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>If it will need power, what is your power plan?</h3>
<p>All lights used for this installation are solar or battery powered, eliminating the need for a generator. </p><h3>Does the piece incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is it climbable?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>If it does incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is climbable what is your safety plan?  [Note: if flame effects are used, your project will be subject to inspection by the Burnable Art Lead, who has final say if your project will burn during the event.]</h3>
<p>This installation does not incorporate flame effects and is not climbable, however it contains moving pieces activated by the nearby merry-go-round. All moving parts are at least 9’ off the ground and outside people’s reach.
</p><h3>Does this piece already exist?</h3>
<p>Proposed Concept (Not Yet)</p><h3>What is your timeline detailing the planning, creation, installment, and leave no trace removal of your project?</h3>
<p>Design has been finalized and we are now working on details. The build will commence as soon as we receive funds for materials. All pieces will be pre-cut, sanded and painted as needed, pre-assembled in large sections, and checked to ensure they fit together during the pre-Flipside build. We expect to need 2-3 build days on the land before opening it to visitors. We expect to need 1.5 days to carefully disassemble and transport off the property. Project will bring moop-buckets and moop-sticks to be used for daily de-mooping, as well as for post event cleanup.</p><h3>Have you completed any other large scale art projects? Tell us about it/them: (In this media? Where and when? How did the project go? Did you learn any lessons from those projects we should know?)</h3>
<p>This is my first large art project yet. But I am working with a team of amazing artists and builders with experience in making large and small art. I have always been inspired by the amazing art I see at burns. This is an opportunity I could not pass to help bring together this community art project. I am attaching as an example the work of my co-lead Joshua Owen.</p><h3>Past Projects Art</h3>
<p><a href="./past/app-43-past-1.jpeg" target="_blank" >app-43-past-1.jpeg</a></p><h3>What is the amount you would like to receive? Please enter a dollar amount in this field.</h3>
<p>$1,000.00</p><h3>Budget Spreadsheet</h3>
<p><a href="./budget/app-43-budget.pdf" target="_blank" >app-43-budget.pdf</a></p><h3>Alternative Budget-What is the minimum amount that you would need to bring a version of your project? Please provide an alternate dollar amount that will allow the expression of your vision and concept at a reduced scale. The Art Grant budget is limited and this will allow the jury an opportunity to consider funding a lower cost piece instead of passing on it altogether.</h3>
<p>575</p><h3>Alternative Budget Description (if you would change the piece to match the new budget, please tell us how):</h3>
<p>Overall budget for this project is way more than $1000 and we are attempting to raise these funds privately. It has been a big undertaking and every dollar helps</p><h3>Have you ever received an art grant in the past?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>Have you received funding from any other entity or regional for this piece previously? If so, who and how much and what are you changing? (Having received past funding will not disqualify you if you are using the funds to add to the piece.)</h3>
<p>no</p><h3>We may be having the next Ignition Philter fundraiser in Austin in fall of 2025 or spring of 2026. If the piece is still intact, would you be willing/ able to bring the piece to that event? [Or do you have another piece you would like to bring instead?]</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>In 2025-2026 We are hoping the some of the artists can give community workshops outside of Flipside at Lloyd, our Austin workshop. Do you think you have a workshop idea that could be provided to the community? If so, please tell us what it is</h3>
<p>We intend to keep outer walls of the pedestal and combine them with walls from other components to make another art piece that can be displayed at Ignition Philter fundraiser in the spring of 2026

Post event this art piece is heading for Burning Man 2025 as a part of Whirl of Art  project. Our team can organize a workshop in 2025 with a panel of artists who have successfully taken projects to Burning Man in the past talking about the process, funding, project management, successes and pitfalls.
