        <h1>14 - The Liminal Lodge</h1>
        <hr/>
        <h3>Application Number</h3>
<p></p><h3>Description for the Jury: Explain the Project in Full. [This is the description that should explain why the jury should give you the funds so try to answer any questions they might have. Please include some language on how the Flipizens will interact with the piece.]</h3>
<p>The Liminal Lodge is an immersive, stylized outpost blending art, function, and mystery to create a versatile community space. Housed in a 15-foot octagonal bell tent, the Lodge serves as a haven for relaxation, discovery, and practical needs. Visitors can access essentials like water and electrolyte refill stations, shade, fans, and a self-service gift market stocked with useful items such as first aid supplies, soaps, and lens wipes. Inspired by Gravity Falls, X-Files, and Meow Wolf, the Lodge features an abandoned outpost and research facility aesthetic, filled with interactive props and a custom-written narrative mystery centered on “The Gravitational Anomaly of Spacetime Hyperactivity.” Guests can casually relax or dive into activities like investigating clues or playing games, engaging with a trippy, dark academia vibe. Seamlessly integrating visual storytelling with functionality, the Liminal Lodge provides a unique and memorable space for exploration, connection, and engagement.</p><h3>Will it need power?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>If it will need power, what is your power plan?</h3>
<p>All low-voltage electronics within the art piece will be powered by a portable 12 volt power bank. The 120v fans will be powered by a small generator. The art piece will be located on our Themed Camp site, so maintenance will be simple and coordinated within the camp.</p><h3>Does the piece incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is it climbable?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>If it does incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is climbable what is your safety plan?  [Note: if flame effects are used, your project will be subject to inspection by the Burnable Art Lead, who has final say if your project will burn during the event.]</h3>
<p>n/a</p><h3>Does this piece already exist?</h3>
<p>In Progress (Making Changes)</p><h3>What is your timeline detailing the planning, creation, installment, and leave no trace removal of your project?</h3>

How did the project go? Did you learn any lessons from those projects we should know?)</h3>
<p>Professional Project Architect
As a professional project architect, I manage large-scale projects nationwide, focusing on balancing design with meticulous planning and execution. I specialize in breaking down intricate designs into clear, actionable steps, ensuring smooth progress from conception to completion. Through effective communication, delegation, and leadership, I guide teams to achieve consistent, high-quality outcomes. My ability to lead complex projects while maintaining attention to detail has resulted in successful project delivery within budget and timeline constraints.

Six Sci-Fi Art Installations at Flipside 2024
In 2024, I spearheaded six sci-fi-themed art installations at Flipside, each featuring immersive, narrative-driven experiences. These projects required creative storytelling combined with detailed visual design to engage participants. From concept development to execution, I managed every aspect, ensuring seamless integration of elements to create memorable installations. These installations provided a blend of interactive exploration and visual storytelling, demonstrating my capability to translate complex ideas into compelling experiences.

Product Runway 2022
Product Runway is a unique fashion competition where architecture designers create garments using unconventional materials often inspired by architectural elements. In 2022, the theme was "Vacation Destinations" and I created a three-look garment that utilized architectural and unconventional materials to tell a cultural narrative of Bora Bora. This project required innovation and precision in material application, alongside collaboration with a talented team. Through careful oversight and guidance, we successfully achieved Best in Show and Best Newcomer, highlighting my ability to merge design excellence with functional execution.

Other Notable Projects
My involvement in various architectural competitions, such as Houston AIA’s Sandcastles and Gingerbread events, showcases my expertise in leading and executing highly detailed projects in unconventional mediums. These projects required thorough planning, meticulous attention to detail, and efficient management of teams to meet tight deadlines. Consistent recognition in these competitions reflects my proficiency in managing diverse design challenges and achieving outstanding results.
</p><h3>What is the amount you would like to receive? Please enter a dollar amount in this field.</h3>
<p>$1,000.00</p><h3>Budget</h3>
<p>app-14-budget.xlsx</p><h3>Alternative Budget-What is the minimum amount that you would need to bring a version of your project? Please provide an alternate dollar amount that will allow the expression of your vision and concept at a reduced scale. The Art Grant budget is limited and this will allow the jury an opportunity to consider funding a lower cost piece instead of passing on it altogether.</h3>
<p>$575.00</p><h3>Alternative Budget Description (if you would change the piece to match the new budget, please tell us how):</h3>
<p>A $575 budget would cover the costs for the tent, Playatech furniture materials, and electronic elements already invested. Any additional funds will go directly toward enhancing the props and set dressings needed to fully realize the concept and vision of this immersive art piece. These additional resources will elevate the quality and detail of the experience, ensuring a more engaging and polished final result. None of the funds will be used for the hydration station or self-service gifts, as these are our camp’s way of giving back to the community. All funds will be allocated solely to the creation and development of the space.</p><h3>Have you ever received an art grant in the past?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>Have you received funding from any other entity or regional for this piece previously? If so, who and how much and what are you changing? (Having received past funding will not disqualify you if you are using the funds to add to the piece.)</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>We may be having the next Ignition Philter fundraiser in Austin in fall of 2025 or spring of 2026. If the piece is still intact, would you be willing/ able to bring the piece to that event? [Or do you have another piece you would like to bring instead?]</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>In 2025-2026 We are hoping the some of the artists can give community workshops outside of Flipside at Lloyd, our Austin workshop. Do you think you have a workshop idea that could be provided to the community? If so, please tell us what it is</h3>
