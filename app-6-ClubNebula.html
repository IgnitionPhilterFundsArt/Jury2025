            <h1>6 - Club Nebula</h1>
            <hr/>
            <h3>Description for the Jury: Explain the Project in Full. [This is the description that should explain why the jury should give you the funds so try to answer any questions they might have. Please include some language on how the Flipizens will interact with the piece.]</h3>
<p>Club Nebula redefines the boundaries of immersive art and nightlife. In the heart of a 30x30-foot club, surrounded on all sides by thin black netting, there are three aluminum cubes—standing 7, 8, and 9 feet tall. Lined in LED lights, the cubes pulse and glow in perfect harmony with a fleet of 100 drones soaring directly overhead.
This experience invites attendees to step into a surreal, futuristic playground where art comes alive above and around them. Club Nebula redefines how we experience drone artwork, turning the sky into an immersive performance space and the club into a transcendent dreamscape.

Flipizens will have three exciting ways to engage with this art installation:

-Dance Floor Immersion
Step onto the dance floor and become fully immersed in the experience, surrounded by a dazzling array of drones flying overhead. Enclosed by protective netting, the club provides a safe and electrifying space where music, lights, and motion converge into an unforgettable sensory adventure.

-Perimeter Viewing
For those outside the club, the 360-degree drone show remains a spectacular sight. Whether you're passing by or the club has reached maximum capacity, you can still enjoy the mesmerizing light displays and vibrant energy from the perimeter. The music, dancing, and artistry extend beyond the boundaries, making the experience accessible to everyone.

-Hands-On Volunteering
Join the magic behind the scenes by volunteering! From assisting with pre-flight checks to managing the show perimeter (front row seat!), this hands-on role offers a unique opportunity to connect with the technology and contribute to bringing the art to life.

<p>Yes</p><h3>If it will need power, what is your power plan?</h3>
<p>We aim to come with drone batteries for all shows fully charged. This means we will only need power to run the computer, speakers, perimeter lighting, and DJ equipment. Currently, we are planning to do this with generators. </p><h3>Does the piece incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is it climbable?</h3>
<p>No</p><h3>If it does incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is climbable what is your safety plan?  [Note: if flame effects are used, your project will be subject to inspection by the Burnable Art Lead, who has final say if your project will burn during the event.]</h3>
<p>** not provided **</p><h3>Does this piece already exist?</h3>
<p>In Progress (Making Changes)</p><h3>What is your timeline detailing the planning, creation, installment, and leave no trace removal of your project?</h3>
<p>This will mark the second iteration of Club Nebula, an evolving project that builds on its existing foundation while introducing exciting updates, fresh drone designs, and upgraded equipment. In January, we’ll conduct a comprehensive inventory of all gear and equipment to identify what needs repair or replacement. February will focus on implementing these updates, acquiring new gear, and fine-tuning the technology. By March, we’ll shift our efforts to designing and programming the shows, ensuring a truly unforgettable experience. 
Our goal is to install the setup as early as possible during the event (timelines may vary as this will be our first time working with early entry logistics). Once the event concludes, all gear will be carefully packed, loaded, and transported offsite. We’re committed to a thorough MOOP sweep of the area, leaving nothing behind and ensuring that the land is not only restored but left better than we found it. This attention to detail reflects our dedication to both the art and the environment.</p><h3>Have you completed any other large scale art projects? Tell us about it/them: (In this media? Where and when? How did the project go? Did you learn any lessons from those projects we should know?)</h3>
<p>Our collective has brought large scale drone projects to Burning Man since 2021 and regional burns since 2023. 

We brought the first version of Club Nebula to Burning Man in 2023. We had great success and a few magical nights with our club before the rain came and shut down the burn. Since then we’ve been wanting to bring back and up level the club. We learned a lot from our first efforts with Club Nebula including how and where not to route wiring, what to use and not use when fastening our LEDs to the cubes, and most importantly, people will climb on everything even if your art isn’t climbable.

<p>** not provided **</p><h3>What is the amount you would like to receive? Please enter a dollar amount in this field.</h3>
<p>$1,000.00</p><h3>Budget Spreadsheet</h3>
<p><a href="./budget/app-6-budget.pdf" target="_blank" >app-6-budget.pdf</a></p><h3>Alternative Budget-What is the minimum amount that you would need to bring a version of your project? Please provide an alternate dollar amount that will allow the expression of your vision and concept at a reduced scale. The Art Grant budget is limited and this will allow the jury an opportunity to consider funding a lower cost piece instead of passing on it altogether.</h3>
<p>$750</p><h3>Alternative Budget Description (if you would change the piece to match the new budget, please tell us how):</h3>
<p>Here is our full explanation about Budget, including the alternative Budget:

We are requesting $1,000 to support the safety component of our project. This contribution would be used to purchase 15x15 baseball/softball netting to create a secure safety zone for attendees during our drone show. This expense represents 48% of our total project budget of $2,085.08.

The full $1,000 will be allocated toward the purchase of Aoligeijs brand baseball/softball netting ($1,049.04 total). This netting is essential for creating a clearly defined safety zone, ensuring that attendees can fully enjoy the drone show in a secure and protected environment. 

Our organization is also contributing $1,085.08 to the project to cover additional critical components, including:
-Starlink Internet Service ($150): Essential for operating the software that coordinates the drones and DJ equipment.
Fuel for Transportation and Generators ($200): Ensures equipment and power are available at the event.
-Behringer Power Amp ($486.04): Powers the larger speakers necessary for delivering a professional audio experience.
-Miscellaneous Expenses ($200): Includes hardware, clips, wiring, tools, and other small but necessary items for the project.
This contribution demonstrates our commitment to investing in the success of this project and ensures that all other components needed for a safe and professional event are funded and ready for execution.
We believe that focusing the requested funds on safety aligns well with the community’s mission of supporting impactful, secure, and inclusive events.

Receiving the alternative budget doesn't change the project cost or specs, we would be absorbing the additional cost personally. We agreed we are willing to do this if the alternative budget is the one that's accepted. If we are given a grant and it's less than $750 then we would have to start downsizing and coming up with alternate solutions. 
</p><h3>Have you ever received an art grant in the past?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>Have you received funding from any other entity or regional for this piece previously? If so, who and how much and what are you changing? (Having received past funding will not disqualify you if you are using the funds to add to the piece.)</h3>
<p>We have never received funding for this piece. Our previous funding was for a different art project. </p><h3>We may be having the next Ignition Philter fundraiser in Austin in fall of 2025 or spring of 2026. If the piece is still intact, would you be willing/ able to bring the piece to that event? [Or do you have another piece you would like to bring instead?]</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>In 2025-2026 We are hoping the some of the artists can give community workshops outside of Flipside at Lloyd, our Austin workshop. Do you think you have a workshop idea that could be provided to the community? If so, please tell us what it is</h3>
<p>To be clear regarding the above answer of "yes",  We would LOVE to bring our project to the fundraiser. It’s hard for us to commit to this when we don’t know the dates. If we can’t bring the drones maybe one of the cubes would be fun, or some PVC pyramids from our 2024 BM project. Our drone inventory is only available against business needs, but we are glad to participate in some capacity!

And as for workshops, yes! We love sharing and teaching. We would be happy to run a workshop on drone technology, or creating lighting for your installations.</p>
