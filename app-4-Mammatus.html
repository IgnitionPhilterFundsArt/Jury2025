            <h3>Description for the Jury: Explain the Project in Full. [This is the description that should explain why the jury should give you the funds so try to answer any questions they might have. Please include some language on how the Flipizens will interact with the piece.]</h3>
<p>Mammatus is a fire art sculpture that consists of a high-volume (relatively) low-pressure flame effect that vents onto the underside of a 10' steel plate.  This forms a mesmerizing slow ripple of flames (a flaming version of a mammatus cloud.)  The disc is securely suspended at 13' from the peak of a dome-like structure built from EMT.  In the spirit of 'graceful degredation' the effect can also be used a a high-volume high-pressure boosh (more effective if wind speeds are too high for the mammatus effect.)  Burners can watch and push the button to ignite (from a safe distance.)  This effect will require me to bring at least 400lbs of propane and rent an 18' trailer for a week.  The combined cost of fuel and trailer is almost $700.  I would like to request $350 if available to help offset those costs.  I have upwards of $2000 invested in the build of the effect (tanks, plumbing, structure, etc.)</p><h3>Application Art</h3>

<p>No</p><h3>If it will need power, what is your power plan?</h3>
<p>** not provided **</p><h3>Does the piece incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is it climbable?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>If it does incorporate flame effects, moveable pieces, and/or is climbable what is your safety plan?  [Note: if flame effects are used, your project will be subject to inspection by the Burnable Art Lead, who has final say if your project will burn during the event.]</h3>
<p>Effect consists of 2 100lb source cylinders with HP regulators feeding 2 7.5gal accumulators manifolded into a 1" vent and valve.  </p><h3>Does this piece already exist?</h3>
<p>Existing Artwork (it's done, just need help bringing it to Flipside)</p><h3>What is your timeline detailing the planning, creation, installment, and leave no trace removal of your project?</h3>
<p>Construction on Thursday.  Build takes approx 2.5 hours.  Ignite Fri, Sat, Sun, GTFO Monday with leave no trace.  Teardown takes approx. 1-2 hours.</p><h3>Have you completed any other large scale art projects? Tell us about it/them: (In this media? Where and when? How did the project go? Did you learn any lessons from those projects we should know?)</h3>
<p>Yes, in prior years I have brought large-scale flame effects such as OCT (flipside 2023), flame tower (flipside 2024), flame cart (flipside 2017-2020).  I have also taken large effects to  freezerburn, burnt soup and Maker Faires.</p><h3>Past Projects Art</h3>

<p>$350.00</p><h3>Budget Spreadsheet</h3>
<p><a href="./budget/app-4-budget.pdf" target="_blank" >app-4-budget.pdf</a></p><h3>Alternative Budget-What is the minimum amount that you would need to bring a version of your project? Please provide an alternate dollar amount that will allow the expression of your vision and concept at a reduced scale. The Art Grant budget is limited and this will allow the jury an opportunity to consider funding a lower cost piece instead of passing on it altogether.</h3>
<p>$0</p><h3>Alternative Budget Description (if you would change the piece to match the new budget, please tell us how):</h3>
<p>I will find a way to self fund if necessary.  </p><h3>Have you ever received an art grant in the past?</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>Have you received funding from any other entity or regional for this piece previously? If so, who and how much and what are you changing? (Having received past funding will not disqualify you if you are using the funds to add to the piece.)</h3>
<p>$250 from Freezerburn for fuel and trailer (I used less fuel there.)</p><h3>We may be having the next Ignition Philter fundraiser in Austin in fall of 2025 or spring of 2026. If the piece is still intact, would you be willing/ able to bring the piece to that event? [Or do you have another piece you would like to bring instead?]</h3>
<p>Yes</p><h3>In 2025-2026 We are hoping the some of the artists can give community workshops outside of Flipside at Lloyd, our Austin workshop. Do you think you have a workshop idea that could be provided to the community? If so, please tell us what it is</h3>
<p>I do a free flame effects class at Lloyd roughly every 3 months.  Would be happy to consider other workshops or classes as well.</p>
